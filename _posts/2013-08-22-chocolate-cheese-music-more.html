<h4> Chocolate, Cheese, Music and More </h4>
 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
   
<p>Our bi-weekly vendors, Litterally Divine Toffee and Truffles, and Ludwig's Farmstead Creamery, are both on board this week with more artisan goodness. Ludwig's is bringing back their cheese curds, so heads-up to all who like this tasty, chewy form of cheese. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Now that August is nearly over, we'll also have the Farm to Fork String Band all to ourselves again. Jon and Myra and a few dozen of their closest musical friends spent the last couple of weeks playing for Pioneer Village, a very popular part of the Indiana State Fair. We trust that they're tuned, tanned, and in fine vocal shape after so much near-daily practice. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Brandywine Farm is stepping outside the blackberry box, and will be treating us to their salsa, made from tomatoes and peppers grown right along with their berries. Not to be outdone, the red raspberries at Redwine Farms are also ripening this week, so you can check in with Jacob for your share of these kissin' cousins of the blackberry. Jacob's great yellow wax beans are showing up too, but we fear the berries will steal the show. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you all under the shade trees from 4-7 p.m. on Friday.</p>
