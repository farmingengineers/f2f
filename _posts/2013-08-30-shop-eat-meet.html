<h4> Shop for Labor Day, Enjoy Dinner and Meet a New Vendor </h4>
 
<p> </p>
  If you've shopped with us in the last couple of weeks, you've probably noticed U-Relish Farms, our newest vendor. Convinced of the idea that tasty, healthy meals need not be complicated or time consuming, founder Cara Dafforn joined forces with Chef Andrew Whitmoyer to create pea, bean, and lentil-based meals-in-a-bag that can simply be poured into a crockpot, mixed with liquid, and heated. Cara started selling the meals at her shop in Indianapolis' City Market in 2010. When business partner Richard Culler came aboard, summer sausage and beef jerky were added to the product mix. 
<p> </p>
 Cara is an Indy-based urban dweller with a love of food and cooking. Richard is a west-Indiana farmer raising cattle and crops on land that has been in his family for generations. Together, they're part of the movement to bring good-quality, affordable, chemical-free food to Indiana. Lately, they've ventured into preserves with unusual flavor combinations, like the sweet-savory tomato-peach salsa. Stop by and talk to them or their associate Kelsey Foster about what's next.  
<p> </p>
 See you all under the shade trees from 4-7 p.m. on Friday!      ~ Market Master Maria
