<h4>September Special Guest and Seasonal Fruit</h4>
<p>We're thrilled to share with you that Tina Jesson, owner of Tina's Traditional Old English Kitchen, will be re-joining us as a guest vendor for the month of September. Many of you will remember Tina from her previous years at the market, before her tea room catering business took off. For those who haven't had the pleasure, Tina is a thoroughly genuine Englishwoman who makes a thoroughly genuine line of English treats from her grandmother's recipes. But you don't have to be an anglophile, or even know the name of the new royal baby, to appreciate the texture of her scones, or the amazing flavor of her fig-and-ginger jam. You'll find Tina in the booth with the British flag and the teacups! </p>
<p>September also means that the blackberries taper off and the grapes and apples come in to take their place. This may be the last week for Brandywine Farm's berries and jam until next year, so don't forget to wish Sheryl and Dan a good 2014 growing season. </p>
<p>And yes, Virginia, there really are organic table grapes in Indiana. Now mind you, they're not the monstrous clusters that travel from California vineyards to your neighborhood grocery, but they have a visual charm and unique flavor that just might hook you. Try the blue ones at Redwine Farm's booth, or the blush and white varieties from Valentine Hill Farm. We promise that swallowing the seeds will not make a grapevine grow up through your nose!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Find all your favorite vendors under the shade trees Friday from 4-7 PM.</p>
<p><div><img src="http://ih.constantcontact.com/fs173/1113873254856/img/37.jpg"></div>Last week for fresh picked organic Blackberries!</p>
