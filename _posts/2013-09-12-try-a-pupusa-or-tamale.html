<h4>What Exactly is a Pupusa? Learn All About It at Our Farmers Market&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>When Juan Vasquez was thinking about starting a restaurant several years ago, he wasn't quite sure in which direction he wanted to take it. But that was all solved one night, says Juan, when he had a revelation in which everything fell into place. In thanksgiving for what he considered divine inspiration, Juan named his restaurant 3-in-1 as a tribute to the Trinity. </p>
<p>So was born a restaurant that honored Juan's Mexican-American roots (he's a native Texan), his wife Luz de Maria's Salvadorian heritage, and a bit of the cuisine of the USA for their younger customers who aren't accustomed to ethnic food. About two years into the Vasquez's entrepreneurial adventure, their westside restaurant was sadly destroyed by fire. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Juan, Luz, and their three sons discovered farmer's markets, and are now making pupusas (the Salvadorian dish) and tamales (the Mexican staple) at about six local markets every week. Eventually, says Juan, they'll open another permanent location. But for now, the traveling version of their restaurant is just fine. </p>
<p>And what exactly is a pupusa? You'll just have to come by the market and find out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. </p>
<p>See us under the shade trees every Friday from 4-7 PM.</p>
