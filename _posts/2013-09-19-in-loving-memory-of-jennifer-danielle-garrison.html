<h4>In Loving Memory: Jennifer Danielle Garrison (1986 -2013)</h4>
<p><div><img src="http://ih.constantcontact.com/fs173/1113873254856/img/54.jpg"></div>Danielle doing what she did so well --&nbsp;sharing the love of her natural products.</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that I must inform you that a member of our vendor community at Farm to Fork Market has passed away. Danielle Garrison was killed in a tragic motorcycle accident in Brown County on September 5. Many of you will remember Danielle as the friendly face behind LuvURCoconuts, the natural skin care business that she had proudly founded and nurtured. In addition to her business, Danielle had recently finished her degree and was employed as a social worker. She had taken a leave of absence from our market to pick up a Friday restaurant opportunity that would allow her to pay down her student loans. She was planning to return for the start of the winter market season. To say that Danielle was a model of industriousness, integrity, and efficiency would be an understatement. Her dedication and positive attitude were an inspiration to all of us. Most of all, we'll remember her smile, and the way she made everyone feel like a friend.</p>
<p>We will dedicate this Friday's market to Danielle's memory. We will have an album available where all are invited to share thoughts, memories, and messages of sympathy to the loved ones she left behind. </p>
<p>Danielle's sister Kellie, and Sherry, mother of Danielle's fianc&eacute;, will carry on the LuvURCoconuts business to honor her legacy. They will join us at market starting this Friday.</p>
<p>See us under the shade trees every Friday from 4-7 PM.</p>
