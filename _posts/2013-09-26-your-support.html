<h4>The Countless Things Your Farmers Market Purchases Support</h4>
<p>Like most of my fellow vendors, I don't have much time to let my mind wander. But wander it did one evening this week, leading me back through the many personal stories I've heard from the amazing business owners that make up our market community. That, in turn, led me to make a partial list of what these small businesses make possible, both for their owners, and for the larger world. If you've ever wondered whether your Friday night detour to buy a dozen eggs, a bag of vegetables, a pie, or a jar of honey is at all worthwhile, I hope this list will inspire you to keep on coming:</p>
<p>1.Retirement income lost when the Great Recession ravaged nest-egg investments for old age.</p>
<p>2. College tuition for at least three young adults who might otherwise not have gone on for more education.</p>
<p>3. Prescriptions and medical visits for at least one family without insurance.</p>
<p>4. The difference between making and not making the mortgage payment.</p>
<p>5. Rent.</p>
<p>6. Employment and sustainability education for farm employees and interns.</p>
<p>7. Last-chance employment for some of Indiana's mentally challenged and mentally ill citizens.</p>
<p>8. A down payment on a new facility or another piece of (sustainably farmed) land.</p>
<p>9. Support for charitable causes that make the world a better place.</p>
<p>10.The majority or entirety of several families' &nbsp;incomes.</p>
<p>11. A humane existence for several thousand chickens, cattle, sheep, and goats.</p>
<p>12. The propagation of over 1000 varieties of heirloom and non-GMO fruits, vegetables, herbs, and ornamentals.</p>
<p>13. The preservation or reclamation of several hundred acres of Indiana farmland.</p>
<p>14. A lifeline for agriculture's most important pollinator: honeybees.</p>
<p>15. Clean, honest groceries that contribute to the diet of approximately 400 local families each week.</p>
<p>Visit us under the shade trees every Friday from 4-7 p.m. or in the old&nbsp;barn in case of rain.</p>
