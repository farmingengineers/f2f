<h4> Can Conventional American Farming Feed the World? </h4>
  Often, when I would get into a conversation about my organic farm, I would almost always get great interest from my listeners, and frequently kudos as well. But just as often, the conversation would end with a statement that could be summed up something like this: while organic food is all well and good for privileged Westerners, it's never going to "feed the world."  
<p> </p>
 
<p>The statement was almost never made in a challenging or argumentative way. It was said in the same tone that people use when they talk about any settled truth, like the color of the sky, or the roundness of an earth that was once thought to be flat. If the listener were still with me, I would counter that all agriculture was organic until a couple of generations ago. Sometimes, I'd even bring up studies that lent scholarly support to the feasibility of an organically fed world. Still, I was usually met with polite skepticism. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>So why HAVE Americans been so convinced that it takes lots of chemicals and large-scale cultivation of millions of acres of corn and soybeans, to keep the world from starvation? Could it be in part that when people have heard the same story long enough, they begin to confuse it with truth? And is it possible to change enough minds to make a difference? </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>One of the better treatments of some answers to these questions came to me recently by way of a radio story, during the morning commute to my "off-farm" job. I'm sharing the link here to remind us all that complex issues often require more than one solution, and to suggest that our efforts as organic farmers and thoughtful consumers may be starting to resonate with a larger audience. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/09/17/221376803/american-farmers-say-they-feed-the-world-but-do-they?utm_source=October+4%2C+2013&amp;utm_campaign=Oct+4+2013&amp;utm_medium=email">Here's the story</a>.</p>

 Visit us under the shade trees every Friday from 4-7 p.m. or in the old barn in case of rain.
