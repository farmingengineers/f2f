<h4> Join us for Autumn Fest at Normandy Farms Saturday, October 19 </h4>
   
<p> </p>
 
<p>We think a new farmers market deserves some new events that we hope will turn into traditions. So we invite you to join us on Saturday, October 19, for our Autumn Fest. Many of our regular Friday night vendors will be there, and will be joined by local artisans sharing their handiwork. Musical entertainment will be provided by the Farm to Fork String Band. These are the lovely musicians who are with us almost every Friday night, except this time, they'll be joined by some of their musical friends. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Local farmer Al Lewis will bring his "pop-up pumpkin patch," where you can pick out not only decorative and pie pumpkins, but all types and sizes of gourds, corn, and more. Enjoy food from rolling restaurants and dip your own caramel apple (apples from our very own Countryside Orchard and Redwine Farms!) for dessert. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>While your kids ride ponies or learn old-time lawn games led by Anna Byers-Scala, browse our Silent Auction and Fabulous Finds tables for treasures, trinkets, gifts, or just plain good stuff for yourself. Stay tuned as we add more ways for you to enjoy the day. Autumn Fest runs from 11 AM to 5 PM, rain or shine. Admission is free and everyone is welcome. All proceeds benefit the ongoing operation of the Farm to Fork Market at Normandy Farms.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Visit us under the shade trees every Friday from 4-7 p.m. or in the old barn in case of rain.</p>
 
<p> </p>
