<h4>Friday Night Market &amp; Autumn Fest on Saturday!</h4>
<p>We know. It's almost too much fun to plug into 24 short hours, but this week only, we are having our normal Friday night farmer's market, and turning right around to treat you to our Autumn Fest at Normandy Farms. </p>
<p>Some of our Friday night vendors will return Saturday, and will be joined by local artists sharing their creations, an animal shelter with adoptable pets, a pop-up pumpkin patch where you can choose your perfect orange orb, and a wonderful gal who will entertain your kids and grandkids with old-time lawn games. The pony rides arrive at 1:30. Dip your own caramel apples, and then browse our Silent Auction and Fabulous Finds booth, or take a chance on our raffle. Our own Farm to Fork String Band will provide the theme music for a perfect day. </p>
<p>Admission is free. All proceeds from purchases benefit the ongoing operation of the Farm to Fork Market. &nbsp;Friday night, the market runs from 4-7 p.m. as usual. The festival opens Saturday at 11 a.m. and runs until 5 p.m.</p>
<p>See you under the (now colorful) shade trees for one or both events or in the old barn in case of rain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;~ Market Master Maria</p>
