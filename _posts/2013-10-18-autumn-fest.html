<h4>Autumn Fest on Saturday!</h4>
<p>Friday evening Market as usual from 4-7 p.m., but some of our Friday night vendors will return Saturday, and will be joined by local artists sharing their creations, an animal shelter with adoptable pets, a pop-up pumpkin patch where you can choose your perfect orange orb, and a wonderful gal who will entertain your kids and grandkids with old-time lawn games. The pony rides arrive at 1:30. Dip your own caramel apples, and then browse our Silent Auction and Fabulous Finds booth, or take a chance on our raffle. Our own Farm to Fork String Band will provide the theme music for a perfect day. </p>
<p>Admission is free. All proceeds from purchases benefit the ongoing operation of the Farm to Fork Market. &nbsp;Friday night, the market runs from 4-7 p.m. as usual. The festival opens Saturday at 11 a.m. and runs until 5 p.m.</p>
<p>See you under the (now colorful) shade trees for one or both events or in the old barn in case of rain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;~ Market Master Maria</p>
