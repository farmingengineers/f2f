##       Friday Night Market Finishes Summer Season  on Friday, Jumps Right into Winter Season Nov. 2

Finishes Summer Season

 on Friday, Jumps Right into Winter Season Nov. 2

 

 

In case this week's weather didn't give it away, summer has come to an end, and so will our first summer market season at our Normandy Farms' location. Get out the flannel shirts and sweaters and join us for one more Friday evening on the meadow.  We owe each and every one of you a big thanks for your support and loyalty over the past six months.

 

Next Saturday, November 2, we switch over to our winter market season, which will run through the end of April. You'll find us in a heated greenhouse toward the back of the property. This will be our winter home while we raise money and work with our landlords to restore the historic dairy barn. Winter market hours are 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. each Saturday.

 

This week, say hello to the owners of Twenty-two Juice, and let them make some tasty drinkable nutrition for you. This is Ross and Leslie's debut at our market, but you may have seen their rolling juice bar on the streets of Carmel, Indy and Fishers.

 

For another noteworthy stop on your shopping trip this week, the Farming Engineers have celeriac, which may be a first-ever at our market. They're also bringing a new batch of chicken sausage just in time for cold-weather comfort meals.

 

See you Friday from 4-7 p.m. under orange and yellow trees or in the old barn in case of rain.
