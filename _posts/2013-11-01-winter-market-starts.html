<h4>Winter Season Starts at Farm to Fork Market Tomorrow, Saturday!</h4>
 
<h4> </h4>
 Remember that our Winter Season starts this Saturday, November 2! We open at 9:00 AM and run until 12:30. Look for us in the paved area between the white silos, loading dock, and dairy barn. Visit with your favorite vendors from summer market, and meet new addition Twenty-Two Juice. We'll be introducing more new vendors in the next few weeks.     We still need lots of willing hands to help us raise the hoophouse that will serve as our winter building. If you are free Saturday from 12:30 until 3:30, or Sunday from noon to 5:00, we welcome your help. No special skills are needed. If you own a cordless drill/screwdriver and know how to use it, please bring it. Most of the job involves working in groups to fit metal pipes together and hold them in place while someone else inserts screws and bolts. Bring work gloves if you have them. You'll be rewarded with pizza and our undying gratitude. Please respond to 
<a href="mailto:maria@valentinehillfarm.com">maria@valentinehillfarm.com</a>
   so we have an idea of how many volunteers to plan for.    See you tomorrow morning by the barn!
