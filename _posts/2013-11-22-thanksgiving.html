<h4>Live Music, Organic Turkeys, Thanksgiving Ingredients, and a Warm, Dry Hoop House</h4>
 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
  We're grateful that our hoop house stood up to last Sunday's severe weather. With a few tweaks, twists, and the installation of a real front door, it's back in business for tomorrow's Thanksgiving shopping. We're lucky to have local musician Brett Wiscons with us to set the mood while you shop and connect with your favorite vendors. Many will remember Brett as one half of the talented former duo "The Michaels". Brett launched a solo career this year, and we wish him all the best. Along with turkey from Earth Cure Farm (call Rob at 574-892-6351 by 6PM if you want to reserve a bird of the perfect size), we're welcoming back pie vendors Tracy and Kyle, now known by their new name, Lattice and Lard. Vegetables ranging from squash to greens to Brussels sprouts can be found at Redwine Farms and Stillhaven Farms. Don't forget fine cheeses for your appetizer course from Swiss Connection, and coffee from Harvest Caf	Coffee Co.&nbsp;(beans or ground) to wash down all that pie for dessert. Start your Christmas gift shopping with unusual jewelry creations from Carolina Moon &amp;&nbsp;Desert Rose, and Ann Crochets.  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
   See you tomorrow morning under the Hoop House!
