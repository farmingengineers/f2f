              Market is Open, Snow Makes the Farm Look Great!  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 While we're glad that this week's snowfall didn't turn into the meteorological drama that the local weather forecasters were predicting, we must admit that a little snow makes Normandy Farm look downright festive. Come on out and see for yourself! The drives and lots have been plowed, but there will be a dusting of snow overnight, so please drive carefully.  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 Don't forget to stop by at the Friends of Farm to Fork Market table, and place an order for a fresh, hand-crafted centerpiece completely made from local, long-lasting evergreens and wild-gathered plant materials. Candles are pure beeswax and made by one of our vendors. You can choose to have your centerpiece delivered to the Market on December 14, or 21. Each is $15. All proceeds benefit the Market.  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 See you tomorrow morning under the Hoop House!  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
