<h4> Christmas at Normandy Farms this Saturday! </h4>
    
<p> </p>
 
<p>Merry Christmas to our customers, vendors, volunteers, landlords and their staff, generous donors, and community supporters near and far! This Saturday, the Christmas spirit comes in many forms to our little market. Market hours are extended till 2 PM.</p>
       
<p> </p>
 
<p>Our farmers and food producers offer their best for your holiday tables. Many also have special gift packages of their products for you to share with friends and family. See their websites for contact information if you would like something held for you, as many farm products are in shorter supply during the winter months. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Santa arrives in grand style at 10 AM, eager to greet young and young-at-heart visitors until 1:30 PM, when he needs to get back to the North Pole to finish those last-minute toys. Musicians will add to the holiday cheer, and we're very fortunate to welcome local artisans Woven Dimensions, Brenda Kessler Designs, Dickinson's KitchenWare, That's Sew Martha, Chocolate for the Spirit, Blue Marble Custom Wood Working, an organic soap maker, a seamstress of heat packs and warming blankets, and a few other creators of favorite things. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This Christmas, you can also extend your mindful purchasing practices to your holiday d	or. If you worry about the synthetic chemical load and large carbon footprint that go into conventional floral arrangements and centerpieces, you're not alone. Instead, consider gracing your holiday table with a unique centerpiece from Friends of Farm to Fork Market. Every part, from the wooden base to the greens and pinecones, are collected from local farms and gardens, and topped with hand-rolled beeswax candles made by Catherine Green of Bluffwood Creek Co-Op. After the holidays, the centerpiece can be used for fireplace kindling, or set on your porch as a bird-food holder.</p>
 
<p> </p>
       
<p>See you all in the Hoop House from</p>
      
<p> 9 a.m to 2 p.m.!</p>
 
<p>  </p>
