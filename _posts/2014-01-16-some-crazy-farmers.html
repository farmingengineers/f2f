<h4> Those Crazy Farmers! </h4>
    
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>During last week's snowstorm, I had the luxury of digging into a good book I had received for Christmas. It's entitled "Folks, This Ain't Normal" , and was written by Joel Salatin a couple of years ago. Salatin, who describes himself as a "Christian libertarian environmentalist capitalist lunatic" is well-known in alternative agriculture circles as the owner of Polyface Farm, an organic family business in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>He's becoming even better known as an activist who's not afraid to point out the flaws in our industrialized food system, and the real price we Americans pay for our reliance on cheap, readily available feed-lot meat, chemically-grown produce, and nutrient-poor processed snacks. One of those costs is an ignorance about food that results from being increasingly disconnected from its sources.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I won't give away all the good stuff, but here are three hilarious misconceptions Salatin has heard that should give pause to anyone who eats:</p>
 
<p>"You don't have roosters with your hens. How do they lay eggs?"</p>
 
<p>"Oh, that must be the bull, because he's got horns."</p>
 
<p>"Where is the salsa tree?"</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And here are a couple of pithy antidotes that Salatin suggests to help combat that ignorance:</p>
 
<p>~"Raise some animals and prepare them for dinner. Small animals are best in urban settings. A cow might be a bit large for your backyard."</p>
 
<p>~(Learning about) "farms and food production should be at least as important as who pierced their navel in Hollywood this week."</p>
 
<p>~"Involve your family in gardening. A simple plastic solarium on the southern exposure side of your house can provide both winter warmth and horticultural delight. If you make it big enough, you can put in a dining table."</p>
 
<p>~"Why would we rather surround our homes with lawns instead of grape arbors? The first business of the household is security, and surely food is at the top of that list."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Not ready to garden or raise your own meat? We're fine with that. Come see us on Saturday morning as the next best way to get re-acquainted with the source of your food.</p>
        
<p>See you all in the Hoop House from</p>
      
<p> 9 a.m to 12:30 p.m.</p>
