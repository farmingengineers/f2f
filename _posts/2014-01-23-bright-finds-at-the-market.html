             Hasten Winter Along with Bright Finds from Our Market!    
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      Just when winter has about zapped our energy, frozen our smiles and sent us hunting for real estate brochures from warmer climes, someone brings frozen strawberries to market, and then raspberries, and oh my, even blueberries! Set aside from last summer's plenty, this is exactly what we all need at the end of a memorably rough January. The "Thinking Ahead Award" goes to Redwine Farms. See Jacob to get your share of his berries.    But you can't have dessert till you've had dinner, so Simple Taste will be bringing comfort food entrees that you can heat and serve. Jenny has promised us lasagna, shepherd's pie and meatloaf. Take home some of her paleo bread to mop up the juices.     Start your shopping with paleo muffins or those amazing Almond Delight Power Bars from Betsy at the Full Circle Farm table. Her husband probably won't mind at all if you also get some of Full Circle's heritage-breed chicken while you're there.     It's not just the food vendors who've been busy. Dream Girl Soapery's new sea salt bars in Island Coconut and Citrus Energy scents will transport you to tropical places even if you can't travel any further than your own tub right now. While you're soaking away the winter blues, put the wag back in your winter-weary pets' tails with Alaska salmon treats from Pet Lover's Bakery.            See you Saturday morning in the Hoop House from 9 to 12:30.        ~Market Master Maria Smietana
