<p>Voting With Our Stomachs</p>
     
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      Trying to make a difference in the world can sometimes be a discouraging proposition, so it's good to remind each other once in awhile that our individual and collective actions have more impact than we may think. As I was scrolling through the latest edition of Cornucopia's e-newsletter today, for example, I ran across an article on the increasing demand for pastured pork.  
<p> </p>
 
<p>One farmer in upstate New York was quoted as saying that demand for his field-raised pork is so strong, he can name his price. More astonishingly, McDonald's, Oscar Meyer and Safeway grocery stores have promised to stop using meat from pigs raised in crates. </p>
 
<p>According to the article, the demand for more humanely raised pork (as well as other meats), is driven by increasing consumer awareness and concern for how livestock is raised. That concern can translate into a willingness to pay a bit more for meat raised with less cruelty. It's far from a perfect picture of course, and industrial farm operations raising pigs in dreadful conditions are hardly in danger of going out of business anytime soon. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>But even a few years ago, no one talked about pastured pork, and the inner workings of Big Meat were not the subject of widespread public discourse that they are today. Without awareness, there can be no concern, and without concern, there is generally no change in behavior. Farmers markets like ours are here to serve customers like you, who are already voting with your stomachs. But just as important, we're also here to create awareness that we hope will turn into enough concern to change the behaviors of many more eaters. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And if you happen to like pork and care about pigs, our vendors from Full Circle Farm and Fink Farm can help you make pork and other meat choices that make a difference.</p>
