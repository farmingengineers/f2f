<p>Staying Put Where There's Work to Be Done</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
           I recently heard an interesting news story about ideology and American mobility. A couple of psychology researchers at the University of Virginia had taken a deep-dive look into the reasons why Americans move (40 or 50 million of us change addresses in a given year!), and had found that one of the big motivators was ideology. Simply put, these fellows found that when our beliefs (religious, political, moral, social, you name it) are closely shared by those living around us, we're more likely to stay where we are.    
<p>On the other hand, those who find their beliefs to be a poor fit for their surroundings are more likely to move to a more ideologically-matched locale should an opportunity arise. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The research was intended to explain why we have red states and blue states, but it hit home with me precisely because it doesn't explain why so many of us choose not to move, even when we're clearly the square peg in the neighborhood. </p>
   It's something I'd pondered before, especially in the years when we were starting our organic farm. There are many places in the U.S. where such an endeavor would have found more support, a bigger customer base, and arguably, a better income. As it is, I'm a chemical-free food producer in the land of GMO corn and fast-food diets, but I'm not the only one.    The conclusion I came to was that for some of us, the chance to make a difference is more important than the comfort of being around people who think the way we do. Call it contrarian, but preaching to one's own choir gets a little boring after awhile. It's much more fun to try changing minds in a place where so many need changing. There's work to be done here, my friends, and it might as well start with pastured beef, real free-range eggs, and veggies with a bug bite or two.  difference.
