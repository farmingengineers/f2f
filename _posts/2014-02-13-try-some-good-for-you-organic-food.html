<p>Look Out for That Organic Food -- It Just Might Be Good for You</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
           Recently, one of our customers shared a real head-shaker of an anecdote with me. The customer, whom I'll call Carol, has been a devoted organic food buyer for a long time. A while back, she had brought a dish to a pitch-in luncheon at work. A co-worker asked Carol to point out which dish she had brought, so she could avoid it. Her reason? She "didn't want to touch any of that organic stuff."  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Over the years, I've heard similar stories from other customer and from fellow vendors. I still can't help but ask myself what creates attitudes like that. What is it about honest food, grown without chemicals, and prepared without dubious or even dangerous additives, that some members of our society find unappetizing, or even vaguely threatening? Worse yet, how has food that doesn't contain a single nutritionally redeeming ingredient become so desirable and even addictive? </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I realize these are largely rhetorical questions, and numerous authors have filled whole books attempting to answer one or both of them. To me, the reasons almost don't matter anymore. All attitudes take a while to form, and logic would tell you they take a while to un-form. What seems more important is getting wholesome food into the hands (and mouths) of enough people that they can taste the difference for themselves.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Once convinced, some of the new converts become 'good food ambassadors', bringing friends and family members into the flock, and the cycle continues from there. To those of you out there who are already ambassadors for good food, we say thanks. To those of you who are wholesome eaters, but afraid to go public, we're challenging you to reach out. Grab friends or relatives who've never eaten anything that didn't come in a pack or a pouch, and admit that you (gasp!) are an organic eater. Bring them to market. Have them meet fresh chicken or farmstead cheese. Introduce them to a farmer. It might be good for both of you.</p>
