<p>CSA Farmers at Our Market</p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
           Many of our customers already know about CSA programs, but for those who don't, read on. It's one of the coolest concepts in agriculture, and I love to write about it.  
<p> </p>
 
<p>CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture, and it generally describes a program where customers buy a "share" (think of it as a subscription) in a farmer's production season. This usually involves signing a short contract and writing a check to the farmer early in the year, when most farmers have large expenses but little income. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Once crops start producing, the subscriber picks up a weekly box or basket of produce from the CSA farmer. Pick-up sites are usually at a farmer's market, or right at the farm. Customers benefit from getting the best produce the farmer has to offer, and for those pressed for time, it's like having your shopping done for you. Many customers say it feels like Christmas, because the CSA box changes slightly every week, depending on what is being harvested on the farm. The majority of CSA's are vegetable and fruit-based, but some also offer meat, dairy, eggs, baked goods, honey, cut flowers, or anything else a farm might produce.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>At Farm to Fork Market, three of our farmers are again offering CSA programs for the 2014 season: Farming Engineers, Stillhaven Farms, and Valentine Hill Farm. Every CSA farm, including these three, takes a slightly different approach to how its program is set up, so if you're intrigued, stop by and talk to each farmer about what he or she offers. Pricing, product mix, product quantity, season length, and payment options differ from farm to farm, so be sure to ask lots of questions. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Once you find a CSA that's a good fit for your household's needs, you might be hooked for life. Many CSA farmers build relationships with their subscribers that last for years or even decades!</p>
