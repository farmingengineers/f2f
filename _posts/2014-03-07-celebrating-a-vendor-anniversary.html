<p>Borre Brothers Famous Fermented Vegetables Celebrates First Birthday</p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p>They're smart, cute, freckle-faced, home-grown, home-schooled, utterly polite, and they're about to celebrate the completion of their first year in business. That's no small feat, especially when you consider that the oldest of the business partners, Daniel, was a mere 7th grader when he and twin brothers Thomas &amp; William (then 10)prepared their first crock of cabbage. When the brothers initially approached me over a year ago about selling their fermented vegetables at our market, they quickly won me over with their sincerity and maturity. It was clear that these kids had thought through their business plan, and were ready for a chance to prove themselves. While mom Lori was certainly there every step of the way, the boys were expected to understand finances, production, risks, long-term planning, marketing, sales, and so much more. In short, they were to treat their business the same way all of us grown-ups treat ours. A year later, what started as an educational exercise has turned into a venture that has taken on a life of its own. Demand for the brothers' products has grown to the point where keeping up is raising a whole new set of business (and learning) issues. But this Saturday, it's time just to pause and celebrate. Whether or not you make fermented veggies a part of your diet, be sure to stop by and give the boys (and their very patient mother) a well-deserved pat on the back! </p>
