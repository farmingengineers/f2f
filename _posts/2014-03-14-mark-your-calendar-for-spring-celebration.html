<p>Happy Events: Farm to Fork Market's Spring Celebration is a Month Away, and New Baby Farmer Enters World</p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p>Mark your calendars for April 12, when we plan to have a special market day. In addition to our usual wonderful vendors, we'll be bringing in top-quality artisans, Easter treats, plants, seeds, and garden goods. We'll also have space dedicated to our Fabulous Finds rummage sale, which was a hit at our Autumn festival. After market, we'll host a class on gardening basics for beginners. Watch this space for more details as April gets closer! Meanwhile, we'll see you in the hoophouse as always. Soon the days will get so warm that we won't need the propane heaters!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Warmest Congratulations to Liz and Jim Stitzel of Stillhaven Farms. Liz gave birth to 6.5 pound, 20-inch Karsten David on Tuesday. Mom and baby are doing well, Dad is sharing the night shift baby care, and big sister Cadence is efficiently practicing diapering on her dolls. </p>
