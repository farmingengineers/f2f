<p>Organic Gardening Class and Specialty Vendors at Farm to Fork Market's</p>
 
<p>Spring Celebration!</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Have you wanted to start a garden but didn't know where to begin? Do you have school-age youngsters or grandkids that need a concrete lesson in where their food comes from? Need a healthy (and fun!) summer hobby? </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>We have just the solution for you. On Saturday, April 12, we're offering a brief and practical beginner's gardening class as part of our Spring Celebration. The class will begin as soon as market is over at 12:30, and run for about an hour. Our speaker will show you how to get started, and you'll have a chance to ask an organic gardening pro questions.  </p>
  
<p>Sign up at the Friends of the Market table starting this Saturday. The cost for the class is $10, but everyone who PRE-REGISTERS will go home with free seeds, helpful resources, and a $5 coupon to spend at the </p>
 
<p>Market. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>For those of you who have missed our credit card service at the market, you'll be glad to know we're bringing it back starting this Saturday. We finally sent our old credit card machine to the dead electronics recycling heap and updated to a Square. Just stop by the Friends of the Market table. We'll run your card for any amount you wish in $5 increments, plus a $1 service fee. We then give you 'Market Money' vouchers that you can use just like cash with any vendor. It's that simple.</p>
 
<p> </p>
