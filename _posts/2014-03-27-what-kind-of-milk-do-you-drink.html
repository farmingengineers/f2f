<p>What kind of milk do YOU drink?</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>One of my co-workers recently had dinner with a conventional dairy farmer from Wisconsin. When asked his opinion of organic milk, the dairy farmer stated, "Milk is milk. There's no reason to pay more for organic milk. The antibiotic residues in conventional milk are so low these days that they can hardly be measured. Too low to do any harm to people."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Say What? </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>It should be noted that the dairy farmer is also a part-time consultant to one of the nation's largest animal-feed companies, so his beliefs should perhaps come as no surprise. Still, one wonders whether this man would even recognize the absurdity of his statement. Has it ever occurred to him that antibiotics, even in trace amounts, have absolutely no business in food? More importantly, shouldn't it alarm as all that adulteration of our food is now so casual and commonplace that many of us don't even question it?</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I should note that the antibiotics that end up in conventionally grown milk, meat, and other foods, don't get there because they were used to treat a sick cow. Animal feed producers learned long ago that adding antibiotics to feed speeds up the animal's growth and weight gain, thus getting it to marketable size faster. (See the profit motive there?)</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>As we all know, what goes in must come out, so for decades now, everything that leaves an antibiotic-fed animal-from milk to droppings--is laced with various amounts of antibiotic residue. These residues are one of the major reasons for the alarming increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. It should come as no surprise that as these resistant bacteria find their way back to people; they cause infections that are becoming famously hard to treat. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>As for my co-worker, I think the conversation with the dairy farmer only served to justify further his conventional milk purchasing habits. My arguments about leaving a better world for his two precious grandkids didn't seem to resonate. He had heard, however, that organic food does tend to taste better, so he might not be a lost cause yet. </p>
