<p>Take the LOCAL PLEDGE!</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Yesterday, I spent a worthwhile 3 hours away from my farm to attend a class for farmer's market managers from all over Indiana. One of the speakers talked about <a href="http://mylocalindiana.com/?utm_source=April+5%2C+2014+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=April+5%2C+2014&amp;utm_medium=email">My Local Indiana</a>, a grass-roots, volunteer-run initiative that is working to connect Indiana farmers to each other and to the food-buying public, which is everyone of us. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>One of the sad truths about Indiana food economics is that we export most of the food we produce here, and most of what we eat comes in from other states and even other countries. It's not hard to see that something's wrong with this picture. By shopping at farmer's markets, you're already helping keep food dollars in Indiana by supporting local farmers and food producers. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>According to My Local Indiana, if each household substituted just 10% of their current food purchases with local food, we would keep $1.7 billion food dollars from leaving our state.Based on estimates of average household food purchases, that 10% amounts to about $680 per year per household, or only about $13 per week! We know that many of you already purchase much more than that at our market, and we are grateful.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Now you can take the next step and sign up for the <a href="http://mylocalindiana.com/contributor/47#sthash?utm_source=April+5%2C+2014+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=April+5%2C+2014&amp;utm_medium=email">10% Pledge</a>. It's easy-log on to mylocalindiana.com and answer a couple of questions to register. Every week, you'll get a short e-mail questionnaire about your food purchases. It helps you track the portion of your food dollar that stays local, and reminds you of the difference you're making for local farmers and food producers. </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>See you in the hoop house on Saturdays from 9 to 12:30 through April!</p>

 Have you wanted to start a garden but didn't know where to begin? Do you have school-age youngsters or grandkids that need a concrete lesson in where their food comes from? Need a healthy (and fun!) summer hobby?   
<p> </p>
 
<p>We have just the solution for you. On Saturday, April 12, we're offering a brief and practical beginner's gardening class as part of our Spring Celebration. The class will begin as soon as market is over at 12:30, and run for about an hour. Our speaker will show you how to get started, and you'll have a chance to ask an organic gardening pro questions. </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>Sign up at the Friends of the Market table. The cost for the class is $10, but everyone who PRE-REGISTERS will go home with free seeds, helpful resources, and a $5 coupon to spend at the Market. </p>
