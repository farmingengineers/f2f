<p>Join Us to Celebrate Spring!</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>It's always exciting to welcome a new vendor to our market. It's even MORE exciting when one of our current vendors launches a new business. So please join me in welcoming Happy Gourmet, the second entrepreneurial venture of Jennifer Boone, already popular as the owner of Dreamgirl Soapery.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Jennifer and her Executive Chef, Nicole Moran, are filling a product niche that has been missing from our market-prepared deli foods and soups. Additionally, Happy Gourmet will have fruit pies, something we haven't had since last year. The products will change with the seasons and customer demand, but you can be sure that Nicole and Jennifer will always have delicious, organic creations at their table. If there's a deli item YOU have been craving, let them know-they might just make it!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Don't forget that our Spring Celebration starts this week, and continues through next Saturday. We'll be including popular local artisans among our regular vendors, along with Easter treats, a silent auction, our Fabulous Finds mini-garage sale, organic seeds to start your home garden, and even some green and blooming things. All proceeds go toward signage and advertising to get our summer market season off to a great start. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Speaking of summer, mark your calendars: Farm to Fork Market's second summer season kicks off on Friday, May 2, at 4 p.m.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you in the Hoop House on Saturday Morning!</p>
  
<p> </p>

<p>Specialty Vendors and Organic Gardening Class at Farm to Fork Market's</p>
 
<p>Spring Celebration!</p>
  April 12, 9 - 12:30 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 Have you wanted to start a garden but didn't know where to begin? Do you have school-age youngsters or grandkids that need a concrete lesson in where their food comes from? Need a healthy (and fun!) summer hobby?   
<p> </p>
 
<p>We have just the solution for you. On Saturday, April 12, we're offering a brief and practical beginner's gardening class as part of our Spring Celebration. The class will begin as soon as market is over at 12:30, and run for about an hour. Maria Smietana will show you how to get started, and you'll have a chance to ask an organic gardening pro questions. </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>The cost for the class is $10, but everyone will go home with free seeds and helpful resources, ready to start your garden! </p>
