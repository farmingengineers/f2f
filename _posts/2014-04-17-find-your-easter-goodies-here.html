<p>We Love Our Farm to Fork Serial Entrepreneurs!</p>
 
<p>  </p>
    
<p> </p>
  
<p>For the second week in a row, I'm delighted to introduce another new venture by one of our existing vendors. By now, many of you know Betsy and Paul, the friendly faces behind Full Circle Farm, who joined us last spring with their excellent pork and heritage poultry from their pastures just outside of Whitestown. In early summer, Betsy launched Betsy's kitchen, which features a select line of energy bars and granolas. Last week, Betsy introduced customers to Guinea Girl, her third creative venture. </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Guinea Girl Natural and Organic Body Care is a line of lotions, body butters, herbal balms, lip care, glosses, powders, and more, all made in small batches at the farm. Betsy says the idea was born about 5 years ago, when she realized it was important to not only be mindful of what we put IN our bodies, but also what we put ON them. What started as a hobby turned into a business when friends encouraged her begin selling the products that she was mostly giving as gifts at the time. Betsy's products contain organic oils, local beeswax, and medicinal herbs, many of which she grows herself. As her product line expands, she hopes to grow and make even more of the basic ingredients herself. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>As for the Guinea Girl name? One of the interesting poultry birds at Full Circle Farm is the guinea fowl, which are raised for both their meat and their tasty eggs. Although Betsy admits that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, she thinks her guineas are also quite beautiful. It was a natural step, therefore, to let her birds be the "brand face" of products meant to enhance skin health. And as we gals all know, healthy skin is the most beautiful skin! Visit with Betsy on Saturday to learn more about her products. </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Mark your calendars: Farm to Fork Market's second summer season kicks off on Friday, May 2, at 4 p.m.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you in the Hoop House on Saturday Morning!</p>
