<p>Last week of winter season. Summer Market begins soon!</p>
 
<p>  </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>Join us for our last market of the winter season this Saturday, and then mark your calendars for the start of our second summer season on May 2. Remember that we switch to Friday evenings during the summer and fall months! We're thrilled that all of our winter season vendors will be joining us for the summer season, and we're so happy to welcome back seasonal vendors Litterally Divine Toffee (toffee and chocolates), Lattice and Lard (handmade pies), The Cracked Pots (house and garden plants, cut flower arrangements, potting mixes and more), Magnolia Mills (fresh produce), and Three-in-One Restaurant (authentic central American and Mexican food) from last summer. We also have new vendors joining us, but we'll save those nice surprises for future weeks.</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>While you shop and visit with your favorite vendors, you can linger a little longer, because we're expanding our dinner options, too. Happy Gourmet, which is already popular for their delicious deli salads and ready-to-bake pies, will be cooking up grilled foods for you to enjoy at our picnic tables. If you're in a hurry, pick some up to go.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Mark your calendars: Farm to Fork Market's second summer season kicks off on Friday, May 2, at 4 p.m.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Weather permitting, we will be outdoors again this Saturday. Look for us in the paved lot behind the grainery from 9-12:30.</p>
