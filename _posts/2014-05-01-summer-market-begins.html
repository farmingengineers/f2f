<p>Summer Market begins Friday evening 4 to 7 p.m.!</p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p>As our market switches to Summer Season, and markets all over the country open up this weekend, it seemed like a good time to share some current facts and statistics about the farmer's market movement. Turns out, I didn't have to look far: the May issue of National Geographic is all about the future of food. </p>
  
<p>~Since 1994, markets in the US have increased from around 1800 to over 8100-a whopping 74% increase in just 10 years. Winter markets are up 60% just since 2010. Not surprisingly, cities are the current hot spot for new markets. New York City alone has 146, with three of those on tiny Staten Island! Two thirds of all farmers markets are now located in urban counties. One reason for this: Farmers earn higher profits in urban locations.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>~The definition of what counts as local food varies widely. The USDA considers food that travels less than 400 miles to be local. You'll be glad to know that Farm to Fork's definition is considerably smaller: nothing travels more than 90 miles from our farms to your fork.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>~Purchasing directly from farmers cuts out as many as 4 stages of middlemen (brokers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers), which leaves more income for the farmer, who tends to put those earnings right back into the local economy.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>~The local-food and small-farm movement is attracting younger people, which is slowly helping to reverse a troubling trend of ever-older farmers. </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>~And here's the number that some will see as the glass half-full and others as the glass half-empty. I'll let you decide for yourself: Small and medium farms with local food sales account for 95% of the total number of farms in the US, and provide 30% of the local food sales.</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>See you Friday from 4-7 PM, where 100% of us will be happy to see 100% of YOU, our loyal customers. We'll be out in the meadow under the big trees.</p>
  
<p> </p>
