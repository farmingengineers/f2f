<p>Food Security - Growing and Buying Local, Begins at Farm to Fork Market, Fridays, 4 - 7 p.m.</p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>With the recent climate change reports comes the realization that food will be highly impacted globally. The term "food security" has more significance as we have seen the droughts and floods wipe out crops and herds across the country. Food prices continue to rise. Some products will become more scarce. Having a connection to a local source as well as your own supply could become crucial.  </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Growing a couple of tomato plants, and harvesting some spinach, beans or zucchini, isn't going to feed a family, but it's enough to develop a sense of what is needed to garden successfully, along with the confidence to tackle it.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>A few years back, I was fortunate to have heard two nationally respected authors speak in Indy. Michael Pollen, author of best-seller "In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto," is known as a food activist who has brought awareness to the importance of eating locally and seasonally, avoiding processed foods, eliminating chemicals and limiting meat in your diet. Bill McKibben is a prolific author and columnist. "The End of Nature" was first published in 1989 and is considered the first book on climate change written for the public. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> Both authors highlight the importance of acting sustainably in a local environment. Pollan encourages eating more plants. While beefing up the green, yellow and red side of the dinner plate, he also urges us to cut back on meats. This is beneficial for both the health of the individual, and the health of the planet.  </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>McKibben spoke of the value of "connection," as we are living in an unsustainable physical environment. The American Dream of huge homes with large expanses of lawn is collapsing. Our cheap fossil fuel has made us richer with possessions but less connected to community, and we are destroying our very environment as we grow. We own much "stuff," but at what point, he asks, do things own us, and are they worth the cost to the next generation? </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>As with Pollan, McKibben encourages us to think in micro-economic terms. Our impact is softer when we live with a local focus and connection. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>In the local spirit of Pollen and McKibben, try your hand at growing some veggies. Farming Engineers has garden starts available and the Friends of the Market table has a great selection of seeds. And all our vendors are happy to share their garden tips with you. </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>See you Friday from 4-7 PM, where 100% of us will be happy to see 100% of YOU, our loyal customers. We'll be out in the meadow under the big trees.</p>
