<p>Food Security - Growing and Buying Local, Begins at Farm to Fork Market, Fridays, 4 - 7 p.m.</p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p>Very few vegetables create more excitement at a farmer's market than the first fresh asparagus of spring. It's always the first thing to sell out, and the grower that brings it is an instant celebrity. I know from personal experience that it's a hard plant to get started, but once established, it stays put forever. When the soil warms up just enough to convince the slender stems to emerge, they grow like crazy. I've seen individual stalks grow several inches in a single day. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Until herbicides and mowed roadsides became popular, asparagus grew wild in ditches and along fence rows. Americans of earlier generations would collect it the way we still collect wild mushrooms. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Fortunately for us, we have Dan Stout of Magnolia Mills Farm, who does the growing and picking so we don't have to. Dan has been growing asparagus longer than I can remember, and his first appearance at market every year is our sign that spring is firmly established. If you love this great vegetable, come early on Friday, and thank Dan for hanging on for another year (he's threatened to retire from farming a time or two). He'll also have his delicious variety of green onions. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If you've never tried asparagus, it's versatile and nutritious. Just rinse the stems and remove the papery scales. It can be eaten steamed, baked, roasted, grilled, or even raw. It's loaded with fiber, vitamins, trace minerals and anti-oxidants-in short, everything that's good for you.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you all on Friday. Remember that market runs rain or shine. If it's raining on market day, you'll find us in the hoop house between the barns.</p>
