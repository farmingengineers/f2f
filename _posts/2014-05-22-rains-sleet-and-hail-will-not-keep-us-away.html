<p>Help Us Spread the Farm to Fork Market Message</p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>Many of us grew up in the days when personal news was shared in hand-written letters delivered by the US Postal Service, and long distance phone calls were reserved for announcing a death in the family. The wonderful ease, utility, and sheer power of the internet and Social Media still leaves many of us in awe. After starting my farm, it didn't take me long to realize that a website and a Facebook page were minimal requirements for doing business in the 21st century. That became even more true when I took on the task of managing a farmer's market. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This week, we're taking a moment to remind our customers and supporters that we wouldn't be here without you, and you can help us create an even bigger support base with a few simple mouse clicks. If you aren't already a fan of our Facebook page, like us at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarmtoForkMarketatNormandyFarms">Farm to Fork Market at Normandy Farms</a>. Then share us with your local friends, and let them know why you shop here. </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Share the link to this newsletter with your social circle. Let them know about your favorite vendors, your first taste of grass fed beef, or the satisfaction of shopping at a place where every vendor follows sustainable practices. Finally, if you are the owner of a like-minded business, group, or blog, link our Facebook page to yours, and to your website. There's strength in numbers, and those of us devoted to clean, healthy, local food need to continually find and support each other.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Find and support us under the shade trees this Friday from 4-7 PM. We're open rain or shine. Whether you're grilling or just chilling, we'll have what you need for Memorial and Race Day.</p>
