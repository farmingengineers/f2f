<p>'Shrooms: So Good, They Could be A Food Group</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>Oh, wait, they sort of ARE their own food group. Culinarily speaking, mushrooms get lumped in with vegetables, because they grow much like the plants we eat, and fill a similar role on our plates in our bodies. But biologically, mushrooms are neither plants nor animals. They are fungi, a marvelous kingdom all its own in the universe of living things that inhabit our planet. Fungi are so amazing, in fact, that even with all the tools of modern science, we still don't know a whole lot about them. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And why are we talking about mushrooms, you ask? Because starting this Friday, mushrooms will be a regular part of what we offer at Farm to Fork Market. Friends of Farm to Fork Market has struck a deal with Shamrock Farms in Greenfield, Indiana, to source organically-grown shiitake mushrooms. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>You win because you can now add one more reliably chemical-free, locally grown item to your weekly grocery list. Farm to Fork Market wins because the proceeds from the mushrooms help us raise funds to keep our operations going. And Shamrock Farms wins because their small, family-owned business has another outlet for their excellent product. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If you have never tried shiitakes, you're in for a delicious treat. They may well be the most versatile cultivated mushroom in the world, and arguably the most tasty. Whether saut&eacute;ed in butter, tossed raw in a salad, added to a stir fry, roasted with meat, or grilled over an open flame, they have a taste that enhances every dish without overpowering it. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Have we intrigued you yet? If so, get your shiitake share this Friday at the Friends of the Market table.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you under the shade trees from 4-7 p.m. Friday.</p>
