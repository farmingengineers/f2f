<p>Cold Brewed Coffee Comes to Our Market</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>New food trends tend to hit the Midwest after they've made a splash in other parts of the country. But in any part of the country, new foods are often found at farmers markets first, because they're an inexpensive and low-hassle venue with a receptive audience. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We're always thrilled when a new food entrepreneur chooses OUR market for its launch. We would like to introduce you to Black Heart Enterprises, which made its debut at Farm to Fork last week. Founded and run by Jessica Weaver and Emily TeKolste, Black Heart offers a bottled cold-brewed coffee concentrate and coffee syrup. Both products are the result of months of careful planning and experimentation on the part of this creative duo. The concentrate is primarily meant to be diluted for a great glass of iced coffee, but Jessica assures me that it makes a fine cup of hot coffee as well. Both the concentrate and the coffee syrup can be used in countless recipes and other applications, such as over ice cream or in a cocktail. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>During the summer season, Jessica and Emily will also be offering single-serve iced coffee beverages for your sipping enjoyment while you shop. Stop by and learn more about what makes cold-brewed coffee such a great treat.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Don't forget that the Friends of the Market, in partnership with Shamrock Farms, have started to carry fresh organic shitake mushrooms. We also still have a good supply of garden seeds, all of which can be planted throughout the summer and fall. All proceeds help pay the rent and keep the electricity on!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 See us Friday under the shade trees (and sunny skies) from 4-7 PM 
<p> </p>
