<p>Market Thyme and Good Food Rhyme</p>
   
<p> </p>
 
<p>Just truckin' down Marsh Road and what do I see?</p>
 
<p>Pick-ups and tents stretched, from silo to tree.</p>
 
<p>And on every table, such goodness was piled, </p>
 
<p>I just could not help it, I smiled and I smiled!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>An urban farm market is what I had found,</p>
 
<p>But this one would turn my eating around.</p>
 
<p>The veggies were chem-free, the meat was grass fed,</p>
 
<p>No sodium phosphate was found in the bread!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The farmers all told me they raised what they sold,</p>
 
<p>'Cause third-party vending was not how they rolled.</p>
 
<p>They compost their plantings and pasture the cows,</p>
 
<p>Their milk has no hormones, their chickens carouse! </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>There were berries and spinach, and plants in small pots,</p>
 
<p>Some cakes for the sweet tooth, and soaps by the lots.</p>
 
<p>The meats were to die for, the eggs were just laid,</p>
 
<p>And even the pet treats were-fetch this!-handmade.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I chatted and shopped till my money ran out,</p>
 
<p>Then ate a pupusa with cheese and some kraut.</p>
 
<p>I can't wait till next week, this food's all so fine, </p>
 
<p>The only thing missing is you and some wine!</p>
