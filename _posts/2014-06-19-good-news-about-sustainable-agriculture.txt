<p> Special Market Guest: Your Local Public Library</p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
 
<p>Far from being historic relics overtaken by the age of the internet, our public libraries and their highly talented staff have more to offer than ever. Come see for yourself on Friday, when we will have Kate Choplin, the Public Services Associate from the Central Library (and long-time market customer!), and Lygia Bischoff, a librarian from the Pike Branch, as our special guests. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I've asked Kate to brings books and other materials of interest to you, our customers, whether you want to learn more about organic farming, brush up on healthy cooking, or understand the links between food and health. Please utilize these knowledgeable ladies to help guide you toward resources to answer your questions. Whether in print or electronic form, they know where to find it. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>(Note that if Friday's weather is inclement, we will reschedule this event to a future week).</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And Now: Some Good News in Agriculture</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Despite the recent resurgence of "Pink Slime" (yes, incredibly, this chemical-washed, beef-scrap product produced by Cargill is once again being added to certain grocery store and restaurant ground beef in the face of increasing beef prices), there is much to cheer about in ag news this month. </p>
 
<p>What I've rounded up here comes from the Cornucopia Institute's e-newsletter (www.cornucopia.org.) CI is a watchdog group that works hard to inform small farmers and the public about the good, the bad, and the ugly, in American and global agriculture.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~It seems that younger people are gravitating toward farming, especially small-scale organic farming, at an encouraging rate. It's still not enough to replace all the older farmers who are retiring, or farmers who drop out because it's a hard way to make a living, but the trend is going in the right direction. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~"Modern Farmer" beat out "Vanity Fair," "GQ" and "New York Magazine" to win a National Magazine Award.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~Enrollment in university agriculture programs has increased in the past decade, and the Future Farmers of America, a youth organization that promotes agricultural education, now boasts nearly 600,000 members - the most it's had since its formation in 1928.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~"Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has called for 100,000 new farmers within the next few years, and Congress has proposed programs to provide young farmers with more USDA support and loan programs." Since the greatest hurdle to getting into farming is finding affordable land, this would indeed be a step in the right direction.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~Vermont will become the first state to require GMO labels on its food. That regulation is expected to go into effect in July 2016.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~Dieticians for Professional Integrity is encouraging the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to reject corporate-sponsored education and increase funding transparency.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>~This spring, Boston is starting the most comprehensive transactional urban agriculture system in the country. A new ordinance allows farmers to grow-and, importantly, to sell for profit-within the city limits.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Friday from 4-7 PM under the shade trees. Be part of the good news by supporting your local farmers.</p>
