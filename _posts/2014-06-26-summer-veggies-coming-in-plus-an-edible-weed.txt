<p> Edible Weed? </p>
 
<p>Yes, Indeed!</p>
     
<p> </p>
  
<p>A few years ago, a new weed appeared on my farm. I'm pretty sure it came in with a load of organic hay that I had purchased for mulching, but it doesn't much matter now. I had seen the weed many times before in other places, but never had reason to go and introduce myself. Once it took up residence among my veggies, though, I thought it was time for us to get better acquainted. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Turns out the new arrival was purslane, also known as duckweed and fatweed, among other names. It's a member of the succulent family, and if it weren't such an annoyingly eager grower, I'd have to admit that like most succulents, it's a rather pretty plant. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Now here's the cool part: once </p>
 
<p>I started asking around, I learned that purslane is not only very edible, it's amazingly nutritious. Aside from being a good source of many of those boring old vitamins and minerals we all need, purslane outshines almost all other plants on the planet with its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Yup, those very same "good fats" that every health expert is telling us will save our hearts and arteries and help keep our weight down and may very well contribute to world peace. Best of all, unlike some other veggies that we're told are good for us, purslane is actually quite tasty (trust me, I tried it myself). The little leaves are very juicy, and have a tanginess reminiscent of lemons or some tomato varieties. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Since I have more than enough purslane for the entire state, and it needs to go before it wins the turf war it's waging on my green beens, I'm bringing lots of it to market on Friday. Stop by the Friends of Farm to Fork table to taste a sample and take home your share. I'll even have some serving suggestions. Now you can have your weeds and eat them too!</p>
