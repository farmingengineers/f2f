<p>Coming Soon - Christmas in July</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Through the generous sponsorship of RDC Farms, Eel River Marketing, and U-Relish Farms, a special event will take place on the grounds of Normandy Farms a week from Saturday on July 19. It's an Art, Food and Music Festival comprised totally of Indiana artists and craftspeople, local organic/chemical-free farmers and food artisans, and Indy-area restaurants using organic ingredients. The musicians and entertainers are all local, too. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We're calling it Christmas in July because Tropical Santa and Frosty will be here to sip some cold lemonade, greet young and old fans, and sign autographs (you really didn't think Santa stayed on the North Pole all year, did you?). And it's Christmas also because all proceeds from vendor booth fees, raffles, and the silent auction will be donated to three unique and worthy causes. Some of the vendors will even be donating all their sales. The lucky recipients will be Boone County Habitat for Humanity's Veteran Build, Pink Ribbon Connection and Friends of Farm to Fork Market. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Habitat for Humanity builds mortgage-free homes for severely wounded service men and women returning from the Gulf and Afghan wars. Pink Ribbon Connection is a grass roots Indy based organization that provides peer counseling, information, patient support, and networking for medically underserved breast cancer survivors. In addition, as many of you know, Friends of Farm to Fork is a volunteer board of vendors and customers who raise funds and generate publicity for the day-to-day expenses and ongoing improvement of Farm to Fork Market. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The event runs from 10 AM to 4 PM. Admission is free, and all are welcome. Event takes place rain or shine. For details and a growing listing of the silent auction items, see our Facebook event page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/654807824604947/">Christmas in July: an Art, Food and Music Festival</a>. "Like" us on FB and let us know if you're coming. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you under the shade trees from 4-7 PM.</p>
