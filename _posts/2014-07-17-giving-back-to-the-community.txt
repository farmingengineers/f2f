<p>Our Market Continues to Give Back to the Community</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p>Several years ago, our market started a tradition of giving back to the community by adopting a family in need of food assistance. Many of you will remember that our first family was Marine Sargeant Jesse James and his wife Nicole and two children. Jesse had sustained severe injuries after several tours of duty in the Gulf wars. We got connected to him by way of Boone County Habitat for Humanity, which had built the James family a little home in peaceful Advance, Indiana. Just about every week for over a year, we would drive over a crate of food, mostly donated by our vendors, but sometimes paid for by generous donations from you, our wonderful customers. Even Jesse's service dog was not forgotten. She would greet us at the door every time, knowing that the crate held her favorite treats from Pet Lover's bakery! The James family continues to do well, and this summer, we've renewed our community commitment by adopting Phyllis, a resourceful and resilient octogenarian widow who is raising her great-granddaughter Bailey, now age 8. Habitat provided Phyllis with an affordable rehabbed home in Lebanon, after the converted barn built by her late husband, had literally begun falling down around her. We look forward to building a relationship with Phyllis, and we continue to be grateful for the generosity of our vendors and customers.</p>

<p>Don't forget that you can enjoy Normandy Farms twice this weekend. Come for our regular market on Friday, and join us again from 10-4 on Saturday for Christmas in July, our first community fundraiser, sponsored by Eel River Marketing, RDC Farms, and U-Relish. Admission is free. Proceeds from vendor fees, vendor donations, auction, and raffles, will benefit the Farm to Fork Market and two local charities. Bid on exciting silent auction items, shop the Eel River tent for fun vintage items, and support our artisan and food vendors showcasing local art and organic treats. This Old Farm will be cooking up grass-fed burgers and their house-made sausages for lunch. Pony rides, pettable farm animals, gourd painting, and more can be found in our special kid's area. Art for the ears and the soul are provided by musical groups Celtric Rain and the Farm to Fork House Band. Tropical Santa and not-so-frozen Frosty tell me they are ready to receive guests in their lawn chairs under the "palm trees" near the Grainery. Our neighbor St. Nicholas Church has generously loaned us their parking lot, and is offering wonderful East European baked goods for sale. The weather promises to be beyond beautiful all weekend!</p>
