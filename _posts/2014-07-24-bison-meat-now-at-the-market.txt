<p>More Food, More Fun and a Simple Way to Make a Big Impact This Week</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p>Many of you will remember Micah Marsh, owner of End of the Trail Ranch, whose amazingly tender bison cuts and flavorful sausage were a regular part of our market last year. We're happy that Micah is back with the same great products, still grown on his farm near Lebanon. A few home-grown babies were added to his herd this spring, and despite coming into the world at several hundred pounds, these little fellows can only be described as just plain cute. Ask Micah to tell you more about what it takes to breed and raise these amazing animals. You'll come away with a brand new appreciation for bison.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>We've also scheduled Kate Choplin, the Public Services Associate from the Central Library (and long-time market customer!), and Lygia Bischoff, a librarian from the Pike Branch, as our special guests this week. I've asked Kate to brings books and other materials of interest to you, our customers, whether you want to learn more about organic farming, brush up on healthy cooking, or understand the links between food and health. Please utilize these knowledgeable ladies to help guide you toward resources to answer your questions. Whether in print or electronic form, they know where to find it. </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Finally, we're proud to announce that our market is joining many others around the state of Indiana to participate in the SEED Farmer's Market Economic Study this weekend. While farmer's markets are sprouting up all over, and clearly attracting an increasing share of customer's food dollars, very little is actually known about the overall impact of markets on the economy. Why do we need to change this, you might ask. There are many good reasons, but in a 'big ag' state like Indiana, our leaders and politicians tend to have open ears for large conventional farming operations and their lobbying groups. Small family farms like those represented at our market are usually ignored when it comes time to make policy or allocate tax dollars. Over time, carefully gathered economic information can help change that. </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>Our friendly volunteers will ask as many of you as possible to answer a few simple survey questions. Your responses will be recorded anonymously. All the surveys for the state will be collected and tabulated by My Local Indiana, a grass-roots volunteer organization working to support small Hoosier farmers.</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you under the shade trees Friday for market from 4-7 PM.</p>
