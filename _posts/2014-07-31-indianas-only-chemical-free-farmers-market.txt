 Farm to Fork's Angelic Apprentice  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>If you've been around the market this summer, you've no doubt noticed an energetic young woman helping at the Friends of Farm to Fork table, or engaged in conversation with vendors and customers. Her name is Angela (Angie) Capretti, and she's easy to spot, because she has a great head of long gold curls that make her look-well-angelic. Like many of our customers, Angie was drawn to our market because of our principled dedication to chemical-free food. As local organizer of the March Against Monsanto and founder of INDY Action Group, </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Angie was already well versed in sticking her neck out for good causes, and she found another good cause here at the farm. She wanted to learn more about how our market operates, and since we never turn down good help, she earned herself the title of apprentice and all the (non-paying) benefits that go along with it.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>In the short time she's been with us, Angie has already made a tremendous contribution by leveraging her social media knowledge to gain more exposure for the market on Facebook and Twitter. Just as importantly, she's continuing the effort to keep us on traditional-media calendars and listings. Finally, Angie was invaluable in helping us publicize our Christmas in July event this month. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>When she's not busy as an activist, Angie has another life as a licensed mental health counselor. A clinical psychologist by training, Angie says she knew from a young age that she would pursue a life in the mental health field. She's also an avid reader, a sports fan, a lover of eclectic music and a poker player. With all that going for her, we just feel lucky that she found time for us!</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you under the shade trees Friday for market from 4-7 PM.</p>
 
<p> </p>
