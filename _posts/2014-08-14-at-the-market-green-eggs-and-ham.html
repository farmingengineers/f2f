<p> CLEAN Eggs &amp; Ham</p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
 
<p>He looked for food that had no junk,</p>
 
<p>'Cause Red Dye put him in a funk.</p>
 
<p>There was no clean food at this store,</p>
 
<p>He did not go there anymore.</p>
 
<p>He looked for clean eggs on a plane,</p>
 
<p>Then hopped aboard a gravy train.</p>
 
<p>The next town had a hungry fox,</p>
 
<p>And all the ham came in a box.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The drive-thru only had McFood,</p>
 
<p>Which put him in a fouler mood.</p>
 
<p>The clean food was not here nor there, </p>
 
<p>He could not find it anywhere.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>But then he came upon a mouse,</p>
 
<p>Who had some clean food at her house!</p>
 
<p>She said she got it from the Farm,</p>
 
<p>A place with food that did no harm.</p>
 
<p>They drove to get there in a car,</p>
 
<p>It was not even very far.</p>
 
<p>Oh yes, there were clean eggs and ham,</p>
 
<p>And yellow beans and kale with jam.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>He bought some eggs and then some ham,</p>
 
<p>He even bought the kale with jam!</p>
 
<p>He did not need to shop the store,</p>
 
<p>Or use the drive-thru anymore.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>His funk was gone, his mood was good</p>
 
<p>He owed it all to cleaner food.</p>
 
<p>He'll always have clean eggs and ham,</p>
 
<p>Thanks to a mouse named Sam-I-Am!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>--With apologies to the late great Dr. Seuss, and in honor of all kids and teachers heading back to school this month.</p>
