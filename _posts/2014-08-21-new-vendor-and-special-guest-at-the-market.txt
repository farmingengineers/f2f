<p> New Vendor and Special Guest at Friday's Market  </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>So many of you have been asking where the sweet corn and apples are. Thanks to Stan and Judy Musgrave of Countryside Orchard, both will be right here this Friday. Everything is late this season, but Stan is finally harvesting his bi-color corn, and picking the apples resulting from the few hardy blossoms that made it through the April frost. It's only a fraction of the apples that Countryside had last year, but they're grown with the same dedication and high standards. Stan gets extra credit for tackling two of the crops that are hardest to grow by organic methods.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Our special guest this week will be Heather Maybury, owner of Earth Mama Compost.Just last year, Heather started a business called Curbside Compostables. In exchange for a modest fee, Heather would provide customers with a container in which to drop their kitchen scraps, pick it up every week, and take the contents to a certified composting facility. The inspiration for the elegantly simple business model came from a relative in Colorado, who had been running a compostables recycling service in Boulder for several years. about how I became interested in this type of business and why I bought Earth Mama. Several years ago my family took a trip out to Boulder, CO. to see my husbands aunt. She had a company like this picking up her kitchen scraps and some yard waste. She was so proud of the difference she was making that she told us every detail. I knew that when I started back to work that I would need to make a difference and have a flexible schedule. This business plan met both criteria. What's even better is that I get to help others make a difference. Last year I started my own compost pick up service, Curbside Compostables. Over this last year I have grown by word of mouth and several events. I was so grateful to Marianne for approaching me with such a wonderful opportunity!A devoted environmentalist with a strong entrepreneurial streak, Heather needed a flexible business that she could manage around her young daughter's school day and her husband's work hours. The composting business fit well with both her values and her schedule. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Fast forward to spring of 2014 and Curbside Compostables was on a steady growth curve. So steady, in fact, that Heather recently bought out her larger competitor, Earth Mama Compost, and quadrupled her client load. She decided to keep the Earth Mama name because the company had great local recognition, which Heather credits to the efforts of the branding-savvy previous owner.</p>
 
<p>If the idea of supporting local businesses and doing right by the planet appeals to you (and we know that it does, because you shop at Farm to Fork Market), stop by the Earth Mama booth and talk to Heather about a better fate for your kitchen scraps. </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 See you under the shade trees Friday for market from 4-7 PM.
