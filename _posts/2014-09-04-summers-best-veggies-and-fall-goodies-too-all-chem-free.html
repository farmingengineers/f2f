<p>What I Learned on My Summer Vacation</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>Much as I love hanging out with the vendors and customers on Friday evenings, it's good to get away once in awhile. If you get away to the right place, you can make a 3-day holiday weekend seem like a full vacation. The area around Saugatuck-Douglas, Michigan, is just such a place. There's so much to see and do per square meter that a few days seems like a week of fun. Saugatuck's location on a river that bulges to form a scenic inland lake and wetland just before it empties into Lake Michigan doesn't hurt, of course. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>But what captured our attention is how the area's small specialty farms and innovative dining establishments have revitalized this long-depressed area into something that feels like hope. Orchards of cherries, peaches, pears, plums and apples, once on the decline, are everywhere now, as are old and new berry farms. Many are small and scrappy-looking, while others are perfectly tended, but the fruit looks and tastes great nonetheless. Family-owned vineyards are getting noticed with prize-winning entries in regional and national wine competitions. Farm stands outnumber gas stations at county road intersections.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And then there are the edible yards and streetscapes right in the towns. Seems like every other yard and curbside lawn strip sports a bed or two that artfully combines colorful summer veggies with annual and perennial flowers and herbs. In one bed, tiny heirloom tomatoes sprawled over flowering dill and cilantro, vined past a plant loaded with bright banana-peppers, and ended under a kale plant that was just to pretty to eat. Wow.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>So instead of souvenirs, I brought back inspiration, which is probably a whole lot more valuable. I am reminded once again that if innovative farming and food culture can occur in an area with brutal winters, soil that is really just dune sand with enough organic matter to support life, and a seasonal economy that depends largely on tourism, it can happen anywhere. We have good momentum going in central Indiana, but we have a lot more work ahead of us. Farm to Fork Market is proud to be part of that ongoing work. Your continued support as vendors, volunteers and customers is a crucial part of that effort. </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p>See you under the shade trees Friday for market from 4-7 PM.</p>
