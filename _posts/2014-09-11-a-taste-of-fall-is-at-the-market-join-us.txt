<p>Waste Not, Want Not</p>
  
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/044fea9bb7e65b3f53046108f7213e21.jpg" class="img-044fea9bb7e65b3f53046108f7213e21"></div></p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>A few weeks ago, I briefly touched on the problem of food waste in my columns, and the more I learn about this issue, the more it nags at me. Since I've never been wasteful in either my food purchasing or food consumption habits, it's not something I had previously given much thought to. I was certainly aware of food waste around me, but I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I hadn't thought about food conservation in the same way that I think about energy or water or land conservation.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I'm sure I'm not alone, though. In wealthy countries like ours, where food is literally all around us, I think we tend to look at food primarily from the perspective of access and distribution. Those of us who care about eliminating hunger among our fellow citizens tend to make monetary donations to organizations that provide food to those too poor to buy their own. Or we might participate in canned good drives, volunteer at a soup kitchen or buy an occasional sandwich for the homeless guy who hangs out outside our workplace.</p>
 
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/11b1b1e9fd44fee3506dc8e9a1bbef73.jpg" class="img-11b1b1e9fd44fee3506dc8e9a1bbef73"></div></p>
 
<p>None of those gestures are bad, of course. But none of them will matter much if we don't start to think of food as a finite resource, the production of which takes a great toll on our planet. In the end, all resources are finite, and the best place to start is by not wasting what we have. </p>

<p>See you under the shade trees Friday for market from 4-7 PM.</p>
