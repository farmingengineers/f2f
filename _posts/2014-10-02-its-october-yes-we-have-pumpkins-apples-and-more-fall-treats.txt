<p>Join Farmer Dan for Local, Seasonal Eating </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>It was a warm, sunny October Friday at Farm to Fork Market. Farmer Dan leaned his lawn chair back against his burgundy Dodge Caravan and pulled his straw hat a little further down on his forehead. A few minutes later, he was startled by a short elderly gal teetering down the gravel drive in her Jimmy ChooChoo platform heels. "It's still so warm", she said to no one in particular.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>"You would think these vendors would still have watermelons and such." Farmer Dan smiled, but paid her no further mind. He had just started wondering whether his canning tomatoes would all sell that day when a tall young guy galloped by, cell phone glued to his ear, but conversing loudly enough for all to hear. "No, baby, I've been up and down both sides, and nobody's selling pineapple and bananas here", he said. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Farmer Dan lifted his hat slightly and scratched his head. Pineapple? Bananas? This was Indiana. What was wrong with people? "Try GreenPod delivery if you want tropical fruit at your door", he started to say, but the galloping cell-phone wearer was already out of ear shot. He put his hat back in proper position and admired his red bell peppers, which were the prettiest ones he had grown in years. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>His musings were interrupted by a mom with three school-age kids, all of whom were snacking on something crunchy and decidedly Red-Dye red in little foil bags. For a moment, Farmer Dan couldn't tell if the crackling sounds around him were the dry leaves on the nearby cottonwood tree, or the kids digging into their snacks. "Hi", the mom said. "My son's class is learning about nutrition. Do you know if anyone here has strawberries and pomegranates? His teacher said he might find them at a farmer's market."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>It was then that Farmer Dan's hat fell off his head, and he found himself jolted awake as his ear brushed the hard frame of the Caravan's open hatch. He looked around. Gone was the mom with the snack-bag kids. So too was platform Choo shoe lady. The cottonwood rustled gently in the wind. All around him were only his fellow farmers, and the familiar customers buying food that belonged in the Midwest in October. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>He remembered what his wife was always telling him: "Don't fall asleep at market, dear. You never know who might show up while you're napping." He had to admit it, if only to himself: she really WAS always right.</p>
 
<p> </p>
