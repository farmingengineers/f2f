<p>Winter Market starts Saturday with a big chill! </p>
    
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>Just a reminder that there will be NO market this Friday, October 31, so that everyone can enjoy Halloween. You don't have to go without your chemical-free groceries, though, because November 1 conveniently falls on Saturday this year. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Join us in the meadow around the fire pit for the first day of our winter market season. Hours remain the same as last year, 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Due to the unusually cool temperatures in August, and no hard freezes yet, some leafy greens will still be available. We will continue to have shiitake mushrooms at the Friends of Farm to Fork table for several weeks yet, as well as organic caramel apples. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Thanks to every customer who supported us this summer. We know that many of you go out of your way to come to our market and to schedule us into your week, and we want you to know how much we appreciate it. Your support is even more important during the 'lean' part of the year, when farmers generally have less to sell, and the weather and morning darkness present extra challenges. You keep us coming back.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 See you under the (mostly bare) shade trees Sat. from 9 - 12:30 until we find an enclosed area!  
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 Please note that there will be no market on Fri. Oct. 31.
