<p>Winter Market Welcomes New Vendor and Slightly Milder Temps</p>
    
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Join us again in the meadow around the fire pit for the week 2 of our winter market season. Hours remain the same as last year, 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We're pleased to welcome our newest vendor, Petality, to the Farm to Fork Market. Founded by Andrea Burkhardt and her brother John Burkhardt, Petality specializes in organic tisanes, which are beverages made from infusing flower petals in water. Until I met John and Andrea, I really didn't know much about this type of brewing art, but they were happy to educate me. Unlike teas, which are generally made from leaves, tisanes use only the flower parts of various plants. The result is a beverage that is not only delightful to drink, but is a great source of various phytonutrients. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The Petality name is a fusion of the word "petal" and "vitality", which accurately describes both the product, and its creators. You'll see what I mean when you meet this energetic sibling duo.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Beyond tisane beverages, the Burkhardt's goal is to expand their business into many other culinary products that incorporate flower petals. We are excited to have Petality join our market, and wish John and Andrea much business success!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 See you under the (mostly bare) shade trees Sat. from 9 - 12:30 until we find an enclosed area!
