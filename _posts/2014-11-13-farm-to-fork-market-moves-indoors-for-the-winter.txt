<p>Market Moves Indoors for the Winter</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We're pleased to finally announce that our market has a warm, dry, and well-lit home for the winter. Find us in the old builder's office right next to the grainery-just follow the signs when you pull in off Marsh Road. It's a huge improvement over the hard-to-heat hoop house we had last year. The place even has a hand-built brick fireplace and chimney, perfect for when Santa arrives next month.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. This week, we really will have Petality with us. I introduced the owners and their unusual flower petal infusions, known as tisanes, last week. Their start at the market was delayed by a bottle shipment that failed to arrive on time, but Andrea assures me that all is well and they are excited to see everyone this Saturday.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Also returning from summer market is U-Relish and their handy crock-pot meals. Considering the temperatures being predicted for Saturday, a hot crock-pot meal sounds really good right now.  </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 See you in the heated building Sat. from 9 a.m - 12:30 p.m.
