<p>More New Foods at Farm to Fork Market </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>This Saturday, we're happy to welcome back Liz Stitzel of Stillhaven Farms. Many of you will remember Liz and her husband Jim from previous winter markets. This season, Liz had great luck growing both potatoes and sweet potatoes, so whether you eat one or both as part of your Thanksgiving dinner, she'll have what you need. Liz also took the plunge into growing several varieties of soup beans this year, and had success with those, too. It has been awhile since we've had dried beans at the market, so if you enjoy making soups, stews, chili, or any other recipe that employs beans, here is your chance to stock up.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The Friends of Farm to Fork will have frozen pumpkin puree made from organic pie pumpkins. Skip the grocery store canned stuff this year, and put locally-grown filling into your pumpkin pie and we'll throw in a recipe for free.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>As in previous years, we'll be taking orders for traditional Advent wreaths, which you can pick up at the market on Saturday, November 29. Each wreath will be made from fresh local evergreen materials, and will have 3 purple candles and one pink candle. Candles are pure beeswax, and are locally made by Catharine Green, the better half of Rob Green, our honey vendor.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you in the heated building neaxt to the grainery Sat. from 9 a.m - 12:30 p.m. </p>
