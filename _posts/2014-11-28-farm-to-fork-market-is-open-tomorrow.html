<p> U-Relish is Back at Farm to Fork Market</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We hope your Thanksgiving was a day of plenty in all the good ways--healthy food, the company of friends and family, and the appreciation of those around us who strive to make the world a better and more hospitable place.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Personally, I am thankful for all of you, who keep us in business, and for my vendors, who keep producing healthy food against tall odds. I'm grateful for our landlord, who works with us to provide a year-round venue that is stable and affordable. Last but not least, I am thankful for our volunteer newsletter editor, Lynn Jenkins, who keeps us all informed every week about what's going on at Market. Lynn is enjoying a well-deserved break this week.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If you have turkey leftovers, or even if your kitchen has never seen a turkey, please visit our vendor U-Relish this week. Many of you will remember them from summer market, but if you don't, they have dried organic mixes that can be fixed as crock-pot meals or soups. Cook as-is for a vegan meal, or add leftover turkey, ham, or any other meat for an omnivore's treat. Easy, healthy, and affordable! </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you in the heated building next to the grainery Saturday from 9 a.m - 12:30 p.m. </p>
