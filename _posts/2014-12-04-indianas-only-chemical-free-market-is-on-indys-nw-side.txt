<p>Food Fit for a Kid</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>A while back, I was listening to a radio talk show where a guest chef had prepared gourmet lunches for the show's hosts. The meals were cleverly packed in vintage children's lunch boxes, prompting the host to ask if they were "kid's meals". There should be no such thing as a kid's meal, the chef replied. In her opinion, there is no reason to serve children a menu that differs significantly from what the adults at the table are eating. If I hadn't had both hands on the steering wheel, I would have applauded heartily.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>I've often wondered how the whole business of allowing kids to eat only what they like got started in the first place. Granted, I'm not a parent, but as the oldest of four, I remember many years of helping to spoon dinner down the bird-like gullets of my three younger siblings. Once we got past the jar-food stage, we ate what mom and dad ate, although the siblings without a full set of teeth were at least given the indulgence of having their meat and potatoes cut into bite-size bits. Yes, there were temper tantrums, and the occasional projectile spitting of spinach or green beans, but patience on the part of the feeder generally won the day. Researchers now tell us that a new food may need to be offered to children dozens of times before they learn to accept and even like it.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Therein lies part of the problem, I suspect. Priorities have changed since I was young, and busy working parents don't feel they can even make the time to cook a meal at home, let alone put in the effort to get a youngster to accept a healthy but initially unpalatable vegetable. We've all succumbed to 'food fatigue'. Industrial purveyors have stepped right in to filled the void, convincing us that meat-like nuggets wrapped in deep fried crumbs with a side of GMO potatoes and sugared carbonated water somehow constitute a meal fit for a young body. Kids do love them, after all.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Fortunately, many families are working to recover from fast-food addiction and limited "kid's meal" diets. If yours is one of them, we applaud you. Your kids may not understand now why you've replaced their happy meal with a hearty, healthy mess, but 30 years from now, they'll thank you.</p>
