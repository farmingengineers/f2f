<p> Christmas Returns to Normandy Farms</p>
 
<p> </p>
    
<p>We got an early Christmas present last week, when our long-time vendor Alan Yegerlehner showed up with two large sturdy signs he had painted for the winter market! The signs are now firmly anchored at the corner of 79th Street and Marsh Road, announcing the market's day and time to the thousands of cars that pass by the intersection every week. We're so grateful to Alan for his generous donation of his time, talent, and materials. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This Saturday and next, we're offering Christmas ornaments made from natural materials, and holiday centerpieces handcrafted from local, wild-gathered evergreen materials. All proceeds from the sale of these items benefit the operation of the market.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Santa arrives next Saturday, December 20, along with great gift offerings from local artisans, and a chance to create your own unique gift baskets with items purchased from our vendors. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>See you in the heated building next to the grainery Saturday from 9 a.m - 12:30 p.m. </p>
