<p> Santa Arrives at Farm to Fork Market this Saturday</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>We invite you to bring your kids and grandkids to visit Santa, who will arrive at 11:00 AM on Saturday. He'll stay until 2:00 PM, when he has to board his sleigh and head back to the North Pole to finish those last-minute toys and fine jewelry. We'll also have holiday baskets, which you can fill with items from our vendors to create your own unique gift basket for someone special. Get an evergreen centerpiece for your holiday table or a few natural ornaments to add to the tree. You'll have extra time to shop - the market will be open till 2 PM this Saturday.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We thank you all for your continued support of our market, our vendors, and our mission to bring natural and organic food and groceries to central Indiana. We wish all of you a Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, and a joyous week of celebration with family and friends.</p>

<p>Mushrooms will be back for </p>
  
<p>the last time until spring. Sign up for our informative e-newsletter, and use our convenient credit card service if you prefer not to carry cash. Browse our table for handmade Christmas ornaments, centerpieces made from locally-gathered live greens and hand-rolled beeswax candles. We will also have fresh organic Jerusalem artichokes, also called sunchokes -- delicious little tubers that can be used a lot like potatoes (fried, baked, roasted, mashed). They're nutritious and have a nutty flavor a bit like water chestnuts.</p>
