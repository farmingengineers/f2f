<p> This Saturday: Start Your Year with Your Farm Friends</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Remember last year at this time? We had to start every market with snow removal, walkway salting, and ice chopping for what seemed like weeks. I know there is a lot of winter left yet, but I'm a glass-half-full kinda gal, so I'm grateful that we've made it this far without a major snow dump. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If the holiday season left your digestive system in turmoil and added pounds you didn't ask for, add some fermented beverages and foods to your diet. The Yegerlehners have a nice selecton of kombucha at their table, along with their usual line-up of delicious dairy products and meats.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Valentine Hill Farm finally got a winter-worthy hoophouse built this year, and are still picking Swiss Chard that was planted back in July! Come get a bundle to add to your salads or stir fries. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See Full Circle Farm for poultry and organic skin care products. While you're there, ask Paul how the chicken rodeo went. He and Betsy took in a nice flock of heritage breed chickens from a local farmer who's giving up raising poultry, so that means more eggs once the days start getting longer!</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Bluffwood Creek has a limited supply of eggs. As always, come early for best selection. </p>
