<p> GMO Fuss... what's it all about?  </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>"Americans are speaking with their wallets like never before in order to voice our true collective opinion of how corporations and Big Food are working with our food. One critical example of how we are demanding change can be seen where the sale of non-GMO Project Verified foods have more than doubled since 2013.</p>
 
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/d8a77efd33edc8791552a31dae0bc0f7.png" class="img-d8a77efd33edc8791552a31dae0bc0f7"></div> </p>
 
<p>This is no surprise, as the term 'non-GMO' was expected to surpass even 'organic' as a buzz word in 2014 when it came to food sales. One study published by Progressive Grocer showed that consumers want Non-GMO now even more than 'organic.' This ought to give Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta, and the huge food corporations a run for their suicide-seed money: A staggering 80% of consumers sought out non-GMO products in their survey. The non-GMO issue has emerged as a consumer hot-button.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>...Actions like those of consumers who have boycotted Kellogg's, Gerber, Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola, and other GM pushing companies, are making a difference. <a href="http://www.nongmoproject.org/?utm_source=January+8%2C+2015+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=December+18%2C+2014&amp;utm_medium=email">Read this,</a> to learn more about how your food gets a 'non-GMO' label. In the meantime, keep voting with your dollar. It makes a difference." </p>
    By Christina Sarich. Reprinted from Nation of Change e-news site    ~NOTE: Senator Dennis Kruse, an Indiana Republican lawmaker is also concerned about GMOs, and has introduced a bill in the Indiana statehouse requiring GMO labeling on foods. He stated that consumers have a right to know what they choose to eat.
