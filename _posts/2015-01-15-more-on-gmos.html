<p>An Appetite for Labelling GMO Foods</p>
   
<p> </p>
  
<p>  </p>
 
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/af6c0df0244d5f2bafb982d63f23e4e8.png" class="img-af6c0df0244d5f2bafb982d63f23e4e8"></div> </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>A large majority of Americans support labeling of genetically modified foods, whether they care about eating them or not. According to a December Associated Press-GfK poll, 66 percent of Americans favor requiring food manufacturers to put labels on products that contain genetically modified organisms or foods grown from seeds engineered in labs. Only 7 percent are opposed to the idea, and 24 percent are neutral.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Fewer Americans say genetically modified ingredients are important to them when judging whether a food is healthy. About 4 in 10 said the presence of such ingredients was very or extremely important to them. That's higher than the share who say it's important to know whether a food is organic, and about on par with the share saying they consider the amount of protein in a food an important factor.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>For some, the debate over GMOs is about the food system overall. Genetically modified seeds are engineered to have certain traits, such as resistance to herbicides or certain plant diseases. Most of the country's corn and soybean crop is now genetically modified, with much of that becoming animal feed. Modified corn and soybeans are also made into popular processed food ingredients such as corn oil, corn starch, high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Currently, the Food and Drug Administration doesn't require labeling of genetically modified foods, saying those on the market are safe. Consumer advocates backing labeling say shoppers have a right to know what is in their food, arguing not enough is known about their effects.</p>
 
<p>The AP-GfK poll comes as several states have weighed in on the issue. Vermont became the first state to require labels on genetically modified foods last year, passing a law in May that will take effect mid-2016 if it survives legal challenges. Maine and Connecticut passed laws before Vermont, but those measures don't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit. Ballot initiatives to require labeling were narrowly defeated in California, Washington, and Oregon in recent years.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The food industry and seed companies have aggressively fought attempts to force labeling, and have pushed a bill in Congress that would block those efforts. In a December congressional hearing on the issue, members of both parties were less inclined than the public to support labeling. Many questioned whether mandatory GMO labels would be misleading to consumers since there is little scientific evidence that such foods are unsafe. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The food industry has faced pressure from retailers as consumer awareness of GMOs has increased. According to the AP-GfK poll, public support for labeling GMOs was bipartisan, with 71 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans favoring labeling. Even among conservative Republicans, more than 6 in 10 favor a labeling requirement.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 Reprinted from Nation of Change e-news site    ~NOTE: Senator Dennis Kruse, an Indiana Republican lawmaker is also concerned about GMOs, and has introduced a bill in the Indiana statehouse requiring GMO labeling on foods. He stated that consumers have a right to know what they choose to eat.
