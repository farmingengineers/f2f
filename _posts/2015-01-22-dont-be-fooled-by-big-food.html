<p>Big Food Is At It Again</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<p>As if we needed more evidence of deception by the Big Food industry, here is an eye-opening article by Barbara Minton on how High Fructose Corn Syrup is being re-named on ingredient lists:</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Big Food is at it again, hiding ingredients they know we really don't want to consume in their products. This time it's the presence of a new version of high fructose corn syrup. </p>
 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
  
<p><div><img src="/images/newsletters/4e9cd4fd1db3395317bdca1f5271a9d2.jpg" class="img-4e9cd4fd1db3395317bdca1f5271a9d2"></div> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The product is General Mills' Vanilla Chex. The front of the box clearly states that the product contains "no high fructose corn syrup" (HFCS). But turn it over to read the ingredient list and there it is - the new isolated fructose.</p>
 
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/be427080434e7e4d5dbea9ad287e0b4a.png" class="img-be427080434e7e4d5dbea9ad287e0b4a"></div></p>
 
<p>Why is that a problem? According to the Corn Refiners Association, there's been a sneaky name change. The term 'fructose' is now being used to denote a product that was previously known as HFCS-90, meaning it is 90 percent pure fructose. Compare this to what is termed 'regular' HFCS, which contains either 42 or 55 percent fructose, and you will know why General Mills is so eager to keep you in the dark.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>HFCS is a food ingredient that has become widely used as a cheaper replacement for natural sugar during the past 40 years. That 40-year time span has also seen skyrocketing incidence of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. While it has not been established that HFCS is the direct culprit, the circumstantial evidence is hard to overlook.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Consumer watchdog group Citizens for Health has petitioned the FDA asking for labeling specifying the amounts of fructose in products containing HFCS.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Don't be fooled by Big Food. It is essential to read labels on the products you buy. Buy only from companies that have demonstrated that they care more about you than they do about their bottom line.</p>
