<p>Long-Time Customer-Turned-Vendor to Join the Market</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>Pam Bernard has been a regular shopper at our market for years, and appreciates that she can trust what she buys here. Even more importantly, she enjoys the relationships that she has developed with vendors. In particular, she credits Lori Borre with coaching her as she became more interested in fermented foods and their impact on digestive health. After a while, says Pam, she began to "truly understand that if your gut is right, everything else will be good too." </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>As a long-time organic gardener, Pam knew that starting with chemical-free vegetables is the key to getting a good fermented product. She started out making fermented vegetables for her own use, and then gave away countless jars to friends and family because she believes so strongly in the health benefits. "I love people," says Pam, "and I want to help them where I can." </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>Still, Pam admits it wasn't easy to overcome the mental hurdles associated with starting a business, even though she felt a calling to do so. " I had a lot of arguments with God," she says. But late in 2014, the decision was made, and Pam was ready to ferment some serious cabbage. </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>To start out, she's making sauerkraut, which is well-known to most Americans, and kim chi, a spicy-hot Asian version of fermented cabbage that is still catching on in this country. We'll be the lucky recipients of Pam's first commercial efforts starting this Saturday. Stop by to help us welcome Pam to the market, and if you're new to fermented foods, Pam has a wealth of knowledge to share. </p>
