<p>Market Expands Again with Organic Farmer!</p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p>All farmers and food producers have amazing stories to tell. It's part of what makes it such a joy to run a farmer's market, and to include new vendors in our flock. This week, we're happy to welcome Blue Yonder Organic Farm from North Salem, Indiana, and to share the story of its founder and owner, Sara Creech.</p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>Sara, an Air Force veteran and a nurse by training, had a tragic start to her organic farming journey. In 2010, her husband Chuck was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 35. Genetic testing revealed no obvious cause, and doctors gave the Creech's the usual guesses about environmental and occupational exposures.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>"After his diagnosis," says Sara, "we started researching everything we could about alternative medicine, nutritional therapy, etc. to add to his traditional therapy. We began researching the conventional food system and were appalled at how our food is raised. We then learned about organic agriculture and small scale farming and really felt this was the best approach. While he was in therapy, we began visiting local farms in the area for distraction and fell in love. We decided that once he retired from the military we would buy some land and start a farm." Unfortunately, Chuck never got that chance. He passed away in May of 2011.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>In time, Sara realized that her passion for farming was still there. She quit her job as a trauma/surgical nurse. With the help of her sister, she found an available 63-acre parcel near North Salem, and Blue Yonder Farm was born. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>"Everything I know I learned from the hundreds of books I read on sustainable, small-scale farming", says Sara. "I feel strongly that a healthy farm is based on a complete ecosystem- it has a variety of enterprises which are symbiotic in nature, complementing each other and keeping them healthy."</p>
 
<p>Sara started by planting fruit trees and buying chickens-she jokingly calls them the 'gateway animal'--and fell in love. Since then, she has added turkeys, ducks, meat sheep, berry bushes, and more. "I have big plans for what I want it to look like and include in the future," says Sara, "but like all farmers, I am limited by time, energy, and money."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This spring, about half of the farm will become USDA Certified Organic. The rest is currently under cover crops and in transition to future certification.</p>
