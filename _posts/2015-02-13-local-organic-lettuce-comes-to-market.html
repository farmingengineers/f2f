<p>Blue Yonder Organic Farm, Part II</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Last week, I introduced you to our new vendor Sara Creech, an Air Force veteran and former nurse who owns and runs Blue Yonder Organic Farm. Here is the second installment of Sara's very interesting story. </p>
 
<p>"As I began to work on the farm," says Sara, "I realized that working with animals and the land can offer a unique and powerful experience for healing. Drawn from experiences both my time in the Air Force and as a military wife, I have seen how returning military veterans are often faced with an even harder battle when returning home. After attending a farm training program offered by ATTRA/NCAT called "Armed to Farm", I decided that I wanted my farm to be much more than a working farm- -I wanted to share the healing that I have found and help veterans start new small farm businesses."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>So this spring, the farm will be hosting a cooperative training program for veterans interested in small-scale farming. Dubbed "Operation Ground Work" the one-week intensive training program is geared to introducing veterans to sustainable, profitable small-scale farming enterprises. A blend of hands-on experience, farm tours, and classroom instruction offer a glimpse into business opportunities in farming. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Beginning in the Spring of 2016, the farm will begin offering the "Operation Ground Work Incubator Program" (OGWIP), which is a two-year intensive partnership between Blue Yonder Organic Farm and select "Ground Work" graduates who are ready to take the next step and start a small farm enterprise. Participants have low cost access to land, equipment, marketing opportunities and education. Housing will be provided throughout the program and a stipend will be offered during the first year. During the second year, all profit and risk will be assumed by the participant, while continuing the partnership with BYOF.</p>
   . 
<p>We applaud Sara's generosity of spirit and her out-of-the-box thinking as we welcome her to Farm to Fork Market. It's a characteristic shared by all of our vendors.  </p>
    Lettuce Be Glad! Leafy Greens Join Us Tomorrow. 
<p>We'll give Chris Griggs a proper story of his own next week, but I didn't want to miss a chance to give him a hearty welcome. This young dad and carpenter/engineering genius just started his own organic aquaponics business. His first crop is lettuce, but I'm sure he's got more up his sleeve. Get your fresh local lettuce, and talk to Chris about how aquaponic/hydroponic vegetable growing works.</p>
