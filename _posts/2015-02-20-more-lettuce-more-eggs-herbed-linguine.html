<p>Welcome, G&amp;G Aquaponics!</p>
  
<p>Aquaponics sounds like a big word, but to G&amp;G owner Chris Griggs, it just means a way to get into the farming business without worrying about the weather or the time of year.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>A single father of two children, (son Carson, 10, and daughter Parker, 8), the Frankfort, Indiana native had thus far spent his working life in custom cabinetry, woodwork, and home remodeling.  </p>
 
<p>When life changes forced him to look for a way to make a living from home, Chris found that aquaponics provided a workable solution. Very simply, aquaponics is the raising of plants in water, using aquatic animals (at G&amp;G, that's organically-raised tilapia) to provide the fertilizer. Add lighting, a source of minerals, and a way to keep the water circulating, and you've got an indoor farm.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Chris had grown up around ponds and fish, so he already had a strong interest in aquatic systems.</p>
 
<p>Everyone he talked to told him the start-up costs would be high, but Chris says he's managed to build his operation on a shoe string budget. "The best place to buy an aquaponic system", Chris jokes, "is at Menards." All the pieces you need, you can get at a hardware store." </p>
 
<p> He purchased a long-abandoned two-story building on the main drag in Thorntown, Indiana. The upstairs became home, and the ground floor houses the growing operation, which currently covers about 3500 square feet. </p>
 
<p>Right now, Chris is growing several kinds of lettuce, but he'll soon expand into herbs and other leafy greens. Beyond that, the sky's the limit, since there are hundreds and maybe thousands of fruit and vegetable types that can be grown using aquaponic methods.</p>
 
<p>Talk to Chris to learn more about aquaponics, and try his lettuce. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the great taste and texture.</p>
