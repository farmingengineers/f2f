<p> Pet Lover's, Maple Syrup and Food for Local Heroes</p>
  
<p>  </p>
      
<p> </p>
  
<p>Seems like lately, something new and exciting is happening every week at our market, and we couldn't be more pleased. Starting this Saturday, Pet Lover's Organic Bakery products will be back with us. For all whose 4-legged fur kids have had to make do without those delicious Barky Bars, Sweet Potato Chews, and Green Bean Gourmet Treats since summer market ended, the wait is over. Come stock up, and remember that your leashed pets are always welcome at our market, no matter what time of year it is.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>For all our maple syrup lovers, (and really, who doesn't love maple syrup?), Blue Yonder Organic Farm will be bringing the first of their 2015 tapping, a sure sign that spring is not far off. So wonderful to think that some farmers still have the dedication to hike through the freezing mid-winter woods to set taps, retrieve the sap containers, and patiently wait as the sap slowly boils down to become the amber treasure that we all enjoy on our pancakes. Best of all, we know this the local, 100% pure stuff, not some corn-syrup adulterated imitation found in store brands.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Finally, our market is proud to begin year four of our Food for Local Heroes project, in cooperation with Habitat for Humanity of Boone County. Since 2012, when the Boone Co. Habitat folks built their first home for a wounded veteran and his family, our market has committed to providing a weekly crate of food to a Habitat family for 12 months. Our vendors have given generously of their produce, meats, and artisan foods, and generous cash donations from customers have allowed us to buy even more food. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Each year at the Habitat Fundraiser dinner in March, a new family is identified. This Saturday evening, Sara Creech of Blue Yonder Farm and I will be guests at the 2015 fundraiser. We'll learn who our new veteran family is, and we'll speak briefly about Food for Local Heroes and Blue Yonder's program to provide training for veterans interested in farming.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the heated building next to the grainery.</p>
