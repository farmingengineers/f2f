<p>Combatting the Food Shortage Myth</p>
  
<p> </p>
      
<p>Quite frequently, I engage intelligent, educated people in food discussions, only to be faced with their concern that the world is running out of food, and only large-scale conventional agriculture can save us from mass starvation. I'm sure many of you have had the same experience. When I run into a well-written rebuttal to this persistent myth, I try to share it. Here are excerpts from a good one by British scientist Jonathan Latham. Read the entire article at <a href="http://www.cornucopia.org/?utm_source=March+19%2C+2015+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=March+19%2C+2015&amp;utm_medium=email">The Cornucopia Institute</a> and search for 'How the Great Food War Will Be Won.'</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Researchers from Iowa have shown that organic farming methods can yield almost as highly as pesticide-intensive methods. Other researchers, from Berkeley, California, have reached a similar conclusion. Indeed, both findings met with a very enthusiastic reception. The enthusiasm is appropriate, but only if one misses a deep and fundamental point: that even to participate in such a conversation is to fall into a carefully laid trap.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The strategic centrepiece of Monsanto's PR, and also that of just about every major commercial participant in the industrialised food system, is to focus on the promotion of one single overarching idea. The big idea that industrial producers in the food system want you to believe is that only they can produce enough for the future population. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Overproduction is the real food crisis Yet this strategy has a disastrous foundational weakness. There is no global or regional shortage of food. There never has been and nor is there ever likely to be.According to experts consulted by the World Bank Institute there is already sufficient food production for 14 billion people - more food than will ever be needed. The Golden Fact of agribusiness is a lie.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Truth restoration So, if the agribusiness PR experts are correct that food crisis fears are pivotal to their industry, then it follows that those who oppose the industrialization of food and agriculture should make dismantling that lie their top priority.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If the food movement could show that famine is an empty threat then it would also have shown, by clear implication, that the chemical health risks and the ecological devastation that these technologies represent are what is unnecessary. The movement would have shown that pesticides and GMOs exist solely to extract profit from the food chain. They have no other purpose. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Reverse PR? In the age of the internet it is no longer necessary to let an industry decide where the truth resides. The task requires two things; the first is familiarity with the basic facts of the food system. The second requirement is a shift in perception.  </p>
 
<p>The necessary shift in perception is to see that, as in most wars, the crucial struggle in the food war is the one inside people's heads. And that the great food war will be won by the side that understands that and uses it best.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This food war can be won by either side. The natural advantages of the grassroots in this realm are many. They include the power of the internet-which represents a historic opportunity to connect with others; second, that it takes a lot less effort to assert the truth than it does to build a lie-many people only need to hear the truth once; and thirdly, that in this particular battle the non-profit public-interest side doesn't necessarily need a bigger megaphone because, unlike the industry, they are (broadly) trusted by the public.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the heated building next to the grainery.</p>
