<p>Winning a Few Battles in the Good Food Fight</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>'American heavyweights accept $40bn merger after failing to keep up with changing tastes and a desire for fresher, healthier food', screams a headline in today's online version of the British newspaper "The Guardian". The 'heavyweights' under discussion, of course, are Kraft and Heinz. Last month, it was the American icon Campbells Soup that made headlines for job cuts and budget squeezing. Those cuts, too, were blamed on slowing sales as Americans abandon the highly-processed foods we were all raised on for fresher, healthier choices.   But you already knew all that, because like our farmers, you've always been on the leading edge of the food revolution. So enjoy an excerpt from the Guardian article below. Then put together your shopping list for Saturday, and come out to help us win a few more battles in the food wars. It looks like current events are proving us right:</p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>Rapidly expanding demand for fresher, more convenient food forged the $40bn merger of Heinz and Kraft that reconfigured the world's supermarkets on Wednesday. Now, financial analysts and food industry experts say, those changing appetites are expected to set off a wave of industry consolidation as global food giants grapple to adapt.</p>
 
<p>"This is a very difficult time to be in the food business as consumers change the way they eat," said Harry Balzer, the chief food industry analyst at market research firm NPD. "It seems we will see a number of these mergers as a way to create efficiencies." Heinz and Kraft announced plans to create the world's fifth largest food company, which will count Heinz's signature ketchup as well as Kraft Mac and Cheese, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer, Planters and Kool-Aid among its top brands. Balzer, who has followed American eating habits for the past 29 years, said Heinz and Kraft are two big brands that have been brought together by the same challenge: keeping up with the rapid changes in what Americans want to eat - and how they want to eat it.  "People are not storing food as much as our parents did, as they seek fresher food," he said. "If you're no longer storing as much, the people providing the inventory [generally large food conglomerates] will suffer. The de-inventorying of the American larder is not good for food companies." In his annual report of American's eating patterns, Balzer said the US consumer has entered into a third phase of the 'healthy food revolution'. "In this latest evolution, consumers appear to be avoiding foods and beverages that were made to be better for them," he said. "Instead, consumers are going for products that are real and not altered."</p>

<p>See you Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the heated building next to the grainery.</p>
