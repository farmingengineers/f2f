<p>Farm to Fork Market is partnering with Traderspoint Living, the neighborhood magazine, this Saturday to bring you a special treat. Market opens at 9 a.m. as usual, so get your groceries and your Easter dinner goodies from your favorite vendors. </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<p>The Easter Bunny arrives at 11:00 ready to greet your kids, grandkids, and any other little people you want to bring to bring along. The Easter egg hunt starts at 11:15, and runs until noon. We'll also have a crew on hand to do face painting, and our farmers will be bringing live bunnies and ducklings to pet. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Well-known local photographer Henry Aldridge will be on hand to take photos of your youngsters with the Easter Bunny. Each family will receive a free 5x7 photo, courtesy of Henry's studio, <a href="http://www.photographicimpressions.biz/?utm_source=April+3%2C+2015+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=April+2%2C+2015&amp;utm_medium=email">Photographic Impressions. </a></p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>We would like to extend a very special 'thank you' to Traderspoint Living publisher Jamie Eifler for organizing the event, providing hundreds of eggs, and getting Easter Bunny himself to pay us a visit on his very busiest day of the year!</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the heated building next to the grainery.</p>
