<p>Daffodils and Coffee by the Pound are Back at the Market </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p> <div><img src="/images/newsletters/48853469d34fadaf5882a24709898ea4.png" class="img-48853469d34fadaf5882a24709898ea4"></div></p>
 
<p> </p>
       
<p>Have you missed coffee beans at the Market? We did too, so we brought back Harvest Caf&eacute; Coffee Company, whom many of you remember fondly from previous years. We'll be featuring one-pound bags of their most popular Certified Organic roasts, which range from mild to dark and gentle to bold. You can choose between ground or whole bean. Each week, we'll brew up a different roast so you can sip a cup while you shop, and decide which is your new favorite.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p>We're also brightening up our winter market space with potted daffodils, which you can find at the Friends of Farm to Fork table. The organic bulbs were generously donated (and hand dug!) by one of our loyal customers, who has grown them in her yard for years. You can enjoy them indoors until the flowers fade, or plant them in your beds right away.  </p>
 
<p><div><img src="/images/newsletters/4728dd64e03ee6d646013db3c8b08862.jpg" class="img-4728dd64e03ee6d646013db3c8b08862"></div></p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>Daffodils need little care, and will flower each spring for many years. One small clump will spread slowly over time to create a showy swath of early spring color in your yard. All proceeds benefit the continued operation of the market. They're a deal at $2 per pot, or 3 pots for $5.</p>
 
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the heated building next to the grainery.</p>
