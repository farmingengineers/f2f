<p>Carrageenan: How A Natural Food Additive is Making Us Sick</p>
  
<p> </p>
 
<p>(Excerpted from a report by The Cornucopia Institute </p>
 
<p> </p>
        
<p>Organic foods should be a safe haven from harmful ingredients. After all, if organic food isn't safer than conventional food, what's the point, right? So, how did a controversial ingredient like carrageenan get into organic food in the first place? The additive is divisive in the industry because of its link to gastrointestinal issues and a higher rate of colon cancer (in animal studies).</p>
 
<p>Federal organic standards require that nonorganic ingredients must be essential to producing the food (e.g., baking powder for producing organic cookies). Since nearly every product on store shelves containing carrageenan can be found by another manufacturer using an alternative to carrageenan, it does not appear to be an essential food-processing ingredient.</p>
 
<p>Yet carrageenan made its way into organic foods due to carelessness by government regulators, misinformation supplied by corporate "independent" scientists advising the USDA, and successful lobbying by carrageenan manufacturers.</p>
 
<p>For the past two decades, food industry executives and lobbyists have managed to convince enough members of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to give carrageenan its stamp of approval. Their tactics have become increasingly more manipulative and ethically questionable.</p>
 
<p>The NOSB first approved carrageenan in the mid-1990s. As required by law, the USDA had hired three "independent" contractors to perform a thorough scientific and technical review of the additive. In their official reports to the NOSB, the three contractors assured the NOSB that no effects on human health had been identified.</p>
 
<p>Carrageenan came up for it periodic review at the May, 2012 meeting with the NOSB debating if it should be "relisted" on the National List of allowed synthetics and non-organics.</p>
 
<p>Cornucopia staff members were at the meeting and presented scientific studies pointing to carrageenan's harmful effects. Cornucopia staff urged the NOSB to remove carrageenan from the list of approved additives.</p>
 
<p>Meanwhile, industry lobbyists presented misinformation about carrageenan's safety and questioned the credibility of independent research commissioned by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
 
<p>One of the NOSB members took an active role in assisting the carrageenan manufacturers. At one point, she read lengthy excerpts from a document written by the carrageenan manufacturers' trade lobby group, Marinalg, defending the safety of carrageenan. But the Board member misidentified the excerpts as "being from JECFA, a United Nations/FAO body" when in fact they were written by the industry's lobby group. Pretty infuriating, right? </p>
 
<p>It is unclear whether this Board member intentionally misled her fellow NOSB members, or whether she herself was misled by the carrageenan manufacturers' lobbyists (but it's a big mistake, nonetheless-one that could be causing innocent consumers unnecessary pain and discomfort).</p>
 
<p>The NOSB voted, by a slim one-vote margin, to re-approve the use of carrageenan in organic foods for another five-year period.</p>
 
<p>Sadly, even one of the NOSB members who was appointed to the board as a "public interest/consumer" representative voted to allow continued use of carrageenan, despite the strong opposition from every public interest and consumer group at the meeting.</p>
