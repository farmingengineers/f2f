<p>Last Winter Market This Week Summer Season Starts May 1</p>
       
<p> </p>
   Thanks to everyone who came out to support the winter market season this year! I have to say the warm building was a great improvement over the hard-to-heat hoophouse we had last winter.    Enjoy our last day of winter market this Saturday, April 25, and put a note on your calendar to join us for the opening of the Farm to Fork summer season next Friday, May 1.      The Friday night markets will run through the end of October, and our hours will remain the same as in previous years-4 to 7 PM.    All of our winter market vendors will be with us, and most of our summer vendors from last year will be returning. We're also adding brand new vendors to fill more product niches. See the newsletter each week to find out who has joined the market.    Jon Hall, our talented player of multiple stringed instruments, and his crew of fellow folk musicians, will be back for another season, as weather permits.    For those of us who like to eat while we buy (or sell), we'll have more options for all-organic supper choices that you can enjoy at the market, or pick up to take home. We'll do our best to accommodate both carnivores and herbivores in our offerings!
