<p>Welcome Back to Season 3 of Summer Market</p>
       
<p> </p>
    
<p>Don't forget that Farm to Fork Market switches to its summer schedule this Friday, May 1! You'll be able to shop with all your favorite vendors outdoors and enjoy a breath of spring as the trees bloom and start to slowly leaf out. The market is Rain or Shine, so in case of severe weather, we will set up in the winter building. Market hours are 4-7 PM as in previous years. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>If you're looking for fresh greens, there will be lettuce, kale, spring salad mix, cabbage leaves, and fresh herbs. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Farming-Engineers/136276076392635">FarmingEngineers</a> will also have vegetable starts for those of you who are anxious to get your own gardens started. If you need ornamental plants for flowerbeds, several vendors will have a variety to choose from. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Jon Hall and his banjo and guitar will be back to entertain us with folk music and fun. Jon provides his talents for free, so don't hesitate to drop a little tip into his guitar case if you feel so moved.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Friday under the not-quite-shady trees!</p>
