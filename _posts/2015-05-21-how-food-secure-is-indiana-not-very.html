<p>Saving Our Food System</p>
 
<p> </p>
   
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
    Thanks to my employer, This Old Farm, Inc., I'm in Albuquerque, New Mexico this week, learning about local farms and Food Hubs. The two dozen or so attendees are farmers and food activists of all ages and backgrounds, from all parts of the U.S. What we have all realized after the first day of presentations and discussions is how food insecure the U.S. really is.    
<p> </p>
 
<p>We often think of food insecurity as a problem limited to those who live in poverty, or reside in backward states. But our highly industrialized food system, controlled by just a few mega-corporations, makes it cheaper and easier to get food from across the country or even across the world, than from a few counties away in our own states. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>In Indiana, we import most of our food. But even in progressive New England, less than half the food eaten there is locally produced. If a disaster of any kind were to disrupt our transportation and logistics systems for even a few days, the grocery stores we all rely on would be empty in a few hours. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Most Americans, including most farmers, would truly be going hungry in slightly more than a week. Give that a moment to sink in, and then support your local farmers, farmer's markets, restaurants that buy local, and any other establishment that keeps local producers in business. We need them more than we realize.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Your favorite vendors await you with their spring bounty. See you all Friday from 4-7 PM under the not-yet-shady shade trees.</p>
