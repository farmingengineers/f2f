   This Week's Round-Up of Good Food News   
<p> </p>
    Here's a chuckle for everyone who dislikes Monsanto as much as I do. Seems that they're not only trying to merge with Swiss seed giant Syngenta (a company that is itself pretty easy to dislike) but to use the merger as an opportunity to undergo a name change. Hmmm-anyone see history repeating itself here? Hint: This is very reminiscent of what the giant tobacco companies did in the not so distant past.   
<p> </p>
 
<p>This article first appeared on the Nation of Change news site:</p>
 
<p>Documents released by Syngenta include a letter from Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant to Syngenta, suggesting as a part of a corporate merger that, "We would also propose a new name for the combined company to reflect its unique global nature."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p><div><img src="/images/newsletters/cd7c96ca8a4e8e3ba65fafb53365a5c0.jpg" class="img-cd7c96ca8a4e8e3ba65fafb53365a5c0"></div></p>
 
<p> "Monsanto wants to escape its ugly history by ditching its name," said Gary Ruskin, co-director of U.S. Right to Know, a consumer group. "This shows how desperate Monsanto is to escape criticism: of its products, which raise environmental and health concerns, as well as concerns about corporate control of agriculture and our food system."</p>
 
<p> In a 2014 Harris Poll gauging the reputations of major corporations, Monsanto's "reputation quotient" ranked 58 out of 60 companies. In other words, it was the third most hated company measured. "Monsanto is much like Philip Morris when it changed its name to Altria," Ruskin said. "Monsanto wants us to forget about its old scandals like PCBs and Agent Orange, as well as the serious questions swirling around Roundup and GMOs."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>On other issues:  U.S. Right to Know is a new nonprofit food organization that investigates and reports on what food companies don't want us to know. In January, U.S. Right to Know released a report, titled Seedy Business, on the agrichemical and food industries' PR campaign to defend GMOs. For more information about U.S. Right to Know, please see their website at usrtk.org.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>And here is an encouraging piece of research shared by the farm and food watchdog group Cornucopia Institute:</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Professor Elliott Campbell of the University of California at Merced published farmland-mapping research showing that up to 90 percent of Americans could be fed entirely by food grown or raised within 100 miles of their homes. Using data from a farmland-mapping project funded by the National Science Foundation and information about land productivity from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, researchers compared calorie production within a local radius of every American city to the population of each city, adjusting for variables such as diet. For example, local food around San Diego can support 35 percent of the people based on the average U.S. diet, and up to 51 percent if people switched to plant-based diets. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The "farm to table" movement has grown exponentially in the last few years as people seek fresher food from farmers in their own communities. Campbell's maps suggest careful planning and policies are needed to protect farmland from suburbanization and encourage local farming for the future. Organic CSAs are leading the charge.
