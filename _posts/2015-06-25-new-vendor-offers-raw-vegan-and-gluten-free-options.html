   Organic Agriculture and Climate Change   
<p> </p>
    
<p> </p>
  
<p>Joel K. Bourne Jr. has written a very interesting book. In "The End of Plenty," Bourne addresses how climate change and a growing population will affect food production and food availability around the globe in the not too distant future. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>An agronomist turned journalist, Bourne tackles tough realities without resorting to painting a mere doomsday scene. He's fairly blunt in his assessment that the last "Green Revolution," which created the chemical-dependent monoculture farming that we've practiced for the last 65-70 years, has run its course, and left a lot of damage in its wake. He's therefore skeptical of claims made by the biotech lobby that GMO's will bring about the next agricultural revolution, although he's not totally anti-GMO either.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>What's best about the book is that Bourne does a good job of looking at cutting edge, long-term solutions for food production that won't wreck the planet further. It's estimated that global warming might leave half our farmland useless by the end of the century, so it's critical to preserve the half that's left. From aquaculturists in Canada to investors trying to revive the Ukraine as Europe's 'bread basket,' Bourne follows innovators and promising trends in food production. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>He's especially positive about organic farming, which (no surprise to some of us) seems to offer a big advantage in an increasingly dryer, hotter world: the healthy soil matices developed by continuously adding organic matter back to the field creates an environment that is ideal for holding moisture where the plant needs it most. That conserves water, which is already a much fought-over resource, and will be the most precious resource of the future.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>While this book might not exactly be the summer's "beach read," it might be the most valuable book you pick up all year.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>See you Friday under the shade trees, where our farmers are practicing the "agriculture of the future" today, right here in Indiana!</p>
