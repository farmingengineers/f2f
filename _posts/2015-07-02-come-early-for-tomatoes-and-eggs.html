       Food Hubs, Coming to Small Town America         
<p> </p>
   
<p>As we celebrate America's birthday and our country's agrarian roots, it's appropriate to take a look at an exciting new entity that's helping get more locally-raised food into the hands of local customers. It's called a food hub, and I just started working for one. It's enjoyable and satisfying to be part of another cutting edge agricultural trend, and for once, it's a trend where Indiana is not late to the game. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The four recognized food hubs in the Hoosier state are actually on par with, or even a little more advanced, than most of the 220 or so hubs around the nation.  The USDA defines a Food Hub as "a business or organization that actively manages the aggregation, distribution and marketing of source-identified food products primarily from local and regional producers to strengthen their ability to satisfy wholesale, retail and institutional demand."</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Food hubs gather local products and sell them within the same area. While there are many large food companies out there that aggregate and distribute food from farmers and prepared-food makers, food hubs tend to be small, and distinguish themselves by the fact that they generally have close relationships with their supplier farmers. That makes it much easier to trace the food to its point of origin, something that's becoming more important to consumers and food retailers alike. </p>
 
<p> The USDA defines local as within a 400-mile radius of where a product is grown. However, most food hubs don't ship nearly that far, as the idea is to maintain freshness and the smallest possible distribution foot print. As they buy from farmers and sell to restaurants, retailers, institutional food managers, and individual consumers, food hubs keep money in the local economy, which helps stabilize communities, and keeps small family farmers in business. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 So here's a salute to another innovation by and for American farmers! Wishing everyone a safe and happy 4th of July weekend. Market is open Friday as usual. See you there!
