 "Bad Actor" Herbicide and an Organic Alternative!         
<p> </p>
  
<p> </p>
  
<p><div><img src="/images/newsletters/56c49cf10c254fb5628a2a45734d7540.jpg" class="img-56c49cf10c254fb5628a2a45734d7540"></div></p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Dow AgroScience recently launched a new herbicide called Enlist. It combines 2,4-D and glyphosate (the major ingredient in Round-Up) in what Dow hopes will become a blockbuster seller by killing weeds that have become resistant to either chemical alone. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 2,4-D as "possibly carcinogenic to humans." </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Glyphosate had already been classified as "probably carcinogenic to humans." Furthermore, scientists say it's only a matter of time before superweeds will become resistant to this mixture, too.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>This stuff will be used on crops that end up in countless foods you might be buying at the grocery store or eating in restaurants. Why is this important?</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>For one thing, many chemicals that start out being used on farms are soon reformulated as "lawn and garden" sprays. Bottled in handy, attractive packaging, they call out to you from the shelves of your home and garden center. Even those of us who eat organic food and wouldn't dream of hiring a lawn treatment service might be tempted to cheat a little when a particularly noxious weed invades our beloved gardens and flower beds.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>My plea: don't drink the chemical kool-aid; there is an effective organic alternative. I've begun recently to experiment with horticultural vinegar as a way to control both broadleaf weeds and crab grass. I wish I had tried it years ago. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>On our farm, we're using it on the driveway, around the house and on fencerows that surround our planting beds. It has eliminated a lot of hand weeding, hoeing and cussing. At work, I'm using it right in the landscape beds (carefully!), bringing it within a foot or two of our ornamental shrubs and perennials. It kills quickly and completely. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>But here's the real beauty: vinegar easily breaks down into harmless components that won't pollute soil and water the way synthetic herbicides do.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Next week, I'll write about how and when to apply it, why it works, where to find it, and why you should only buy the organic kind. Or come talk to me at Friday's market and I'll leak the story to you in advance. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m. 
<p> </p>
