 Horticultural Vinegar for Herbicide Use: Part 2        
<p> </p>
   
<p><div><img src="/images/newsletters/d820ef8f243b561e6ecbffcc1505d666.jpg" class="img-d820ef8f243b561e6ecbffcc1505d666"></div></p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Recently, I wrote a about horticultural vinegar, which is a highly effective but under-utilized herbicide. Horticultural vinegar is simply a much more concentrated form of the vinegar many of us use in cooking or for household cleaning. Vinegar is an acid, and when applied to plants in concentrated form, it kills by burning the leaves and stems. Horticultural vinegar is broad spectrum, so it will kill both broadleaf weeds and weedy grasses. But note that it will also kill your favorite rosebush or tomato plants if applied incorrectly.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>The best way to apply horticultural vinegar is with a garden applicator that has an attached hose and adjustable spray nozzle. The nozzle will allow you to aim directly at the weed you want to eradicate without bothering other plants. For a larger patch of weeds that isn't near any desirable plants, a watering can may be used. No matter what application method you use, never apply vinegar (or any other herbicide) on a windy day. Liquid mists drift much further than most people realize, and wind direction can shift very quickly. Horticultural vinegar is sold at a 20% concentration and should be used full-strength for best results. It kills best if applied to dry weeds on a sunny day, and if there is no rain for about 24 hours after application.   Use the same common-sense personal safety precautions with horticultural vinegar that you would when handling any chemical. Since this type of vinegar can burn the skin, wear gloves and long pants, and only open containers in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing the vapors. Store the vinegar in its original container with the cap tightly closed. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Horticultural vinegar can be produced either through chemical processes, or by natural fermentation. Look for the kind that is labeled organic or fermented. It costs a bit more, but your dollars are supporting planet-friendly production methods. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Unlike synthetic herbicides, almost all of which hang out in the soil and groundwater and create a pollution issue, vinegar does its thing and goes away. It is quickly diluted by rain or irrigation, and breaks down into harmless components that are useful to bacteria and fungi.</p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<p>Ask for organic or fermented horticultural vinegar at your favorite garden center, or Google for numerous online sources. Prices vary widely, but a higher price does not mean a better product in this case. Buying in larger quantities frequently slashes the cost per gallon significantly.</p>

 See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m.
