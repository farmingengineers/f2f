  Beware Of Fake "Local" Produce - Shop a Vetted Market like Farm to Fork            
<div><img src="/images/newsletters/a2b0063083f5d741ce0e0f683a523ba4.jpg" class="img-a2b0063083f5d741ce0e0f683a523ba4"></div>
      Are you aware that some produce sold at area farmers markets is purchased up to a week ahead at the area produce auctions, stored without refrigeration, and originate in chemically laden farms as far away as Tennessee and Missouri?    The vendors who buy this produce go through great trouble to toss out the auction crates, or pull off the auction tickets, and sometimes transfer the goods to bushel baskets or generic trays. The vendor may even use an old truck and dress in overalls, just for effect. If you ask if the vendor grew it, he may lie or say something about selling it for a friend. (The "friend" is an unknown farmer likely in another state). This is also true for some of the "farm fresh" wagon/stands popping up around town. It's not local, and it's hardly fresh.  Why don't farmers markets stop this practice? Because these resellers often have more product and earlier product than traditional farmer/vendors do. I've talked to market hosts, the towns involved, even the health departments, who are all aware of this fraud and yet they don't seem to care. Misrepresentation of goods is apparently just fine with all of them. Auction goods are usually cheaper, (and they should be because they represent a distressed sale, and may be only hours away from spoiling). So now, you know.   By Rob Green, Bluffwood Creek Farm     See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m.    ~Market Master Maria Smietana
