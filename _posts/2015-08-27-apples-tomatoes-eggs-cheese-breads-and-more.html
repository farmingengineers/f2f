  Feeding Our Children:  Two Articles That Contrast The "Bad &amp; Ugly" with the "Good"       Junk Food Marketing Targets Communities of Color  Some of the same conventional processed food companies that are listening to their customers' demands to remove synthetic and artificial ingredients are, simultaneously, being investigated for target-marketing nutritionally poor foods directly to communities of color.   A recent report by the University of Connecticut Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity examines TV food advertising, and other forms of marketing, to young Hispanic and Black consumers.   The research shows that these young people receive a "double dose" of promotions for products high in sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. In fact, two-thirds of food ads viewed by Hispanic children and teens promote fast food, candy, sugary drinks, and snacks. The companies studied spent a whopping $440 million on such ads while just 3 percent of ads ($10 Million) promoted healthier alternatives like yogurt, other dairy, and 100% juice.    Public health experts are concerned that exposure to racially/ethnically targeted food marketing contributes to poor diet and health disparities for young African Americans and Latinos, including higher rates of obesity and other diseases. Advocates and policymakers have proposed numerous obesity prevention actions, including the need for dramatic changes in targeted marketing practices from key stakeholders within industry. Research like this can help us identify opportunities to protect the most vulnerable members of our communities, young people of color.   First School System in Nation Goes 100% Organic with School Lunches When schools in California's Sausalito Marin City District return to session this August, they will be the first in the nation to serve their students 100 percent organic meals, sustainably sourced and free of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).   More than 500 students at Bayside MLK Jr. Academy in Marin City and Willow Creek Academy in Sausalito will eat fresh, local food year-round, thanks to a partnership with the Conscious Kitchen, a project of the environmental education nonprofit Turning Green.   "Students everywhere are vulnerable to pesticide residues and unsafe environmental toxins," Turning Green founder Judi Shils said on Tuesday. "Not only does this program far exceed USDA nutritional standards, but it ties the health of our children to the health of our planet. It's the first program to say that fundamentally, you cannot have one without the other."   (Articles Adapted from the Cornucopia Institute Newsletter)     See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m.    ~Market Master Maria Smietana
