       Feeding Our Families from Farm to Fork     Try these recipes with some of the produce available from several vendors.  Greens and Beans Kale, mustard greens, beet greens, turnip greens, chard or spinach all work well in most recipes. Dice and cook several slices of bacon or sausage. Remove from pan. Saut&eacute; a chopped onion and garlic in the pan. Use olive oil In place of meat drippings for vegetarian style. Add mixed greens that have been washed and cut-up with center spine removed. After greens are wilted and tender, add a can of cannellini beans (or your choice). Heat through and add meat back to pan. Optional, add diced or shredded cheese such as Parmesan, Swiss or Cheddar.  Grilled Veggies So many of the summer veggies are wonderful grilled, and you don't have to heat up the kitchen. Try any of these on the grill, sliced and on a sheet of aluminum foil with a layer of good olive oil: Beets, yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant.  Grilled Cracked Potatoes Boil small red or white potatoes till tender. Place on a sheet of aluminum foil with a layer of good olive oil and use a utensil to smash the potato flat like a pancake. Brush with a little butter and add your favorite fresh or dried herb (try Rosemary!) plus salt. Add a sprinkle of parmesan or other favorite cheese. Grill until crisp (or use the oven). Potatoes are a good source of potassium, fiber and Vitamin C.     See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m.
