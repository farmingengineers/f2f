       Help Sustain &amp; Grow  Farm to Fork Market!      Please Take a Minute to Support Us; It May Be the Best Thing You Do Today!  Our pitch is short and basic: We need to grow as a market, step up our operations, create professional signage and become a registered not-for-profit. That takes money, but not as much as you might think. We are trying to raise $18,000 via crowd funding, which covers all our costs for a year and leaves us with a solid cushion to pursue more permanent funding. If each person who receives the newsletter or visits the market gives only $20 to this campaign, our goal will be met.   Please contribute - small or large - at our 
<a href="http://www.gofundme.com/3s3ndr3s?utm_source=September+10%2C+2015+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Sept+10%2C+2015&amp;utm_medium=email">GoFundMe</a>
 site. 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
 You can read more details about our campaign, and leave comments and questions there as well. Every dollar helps, and every contribution is deeply appreciated! Thanks for helping keep safe, local food available in central Indiana!  See you under the shade trees on Friday from 4-7 p.m.
