 Hot dog roasts, popcorn, cotton candy and caramel apples are just a few of the fun things happening on Friday, 4-7                  Join us Friday, October 30, for a perfect end to the summer market season. We'll be hosting a neighborhood Fall and Halloween celebration along with the Market.  Dip your own caramel apples, roast organic hot dogs, enjoy fresh cider, and shop our fall craft vendors. Kids are encouraged to come in costume and participate in safe Trick-or-Treat.    Thanks to support from the nice folks at Traders Point Living Magazine there will be pumpkin carving contests for the kids with prizes awarded in several age categories. We'll also have a bounce house, a DJ, professional face painting, cotton candy, popcorn and a balloon artist.    On Saturday, November 7, we switch over to our winter market season. Hours will be the same as last year, 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. We'll once again be in the heated clubhouse next to the grainery. Most of the summer vendors will be there, plus a few new ones to give you a greater variety of both fresh farm products and artisan foods.    See you Friday, 4-7 PM, next to the bonfire!              ~Market Master Maria
