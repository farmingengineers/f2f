          'Twas the Week of Thanksgiving, and All Through the Kitchen...  ...the Smells from the Cookin' Were So Darn Bewitchin'!      
<div><img src="/images/newsletters/21e62be1d09472046bf2a6ae1692cb1f.jpg" class="img-21e62be1d09472046bf2a6ae1692cb1f"></div>
       Join us for what has traditionally been one of the most lively and happy Saturdays of our market year. The vendors are prepared with just about everything you'll need to prepare a farm-fresh Indiana Thanksgiving for your crowd.    Meat abounds, of course. Blue Yonder and Heritage Meadows both have turkeys, as well as other poultry if a turkey is just too darn big for you. Full Circle, Yegerlehner Family, and Heritage Meadows all have pork for those who like to put a bit of sausage or bacon in stuffing or on side dishes.    Countryside Orchard has good vegetables as well as apples for your pies. Check in at the Friends of Farm to Fork table for frozen, ready to use pumpkin puree, handmade by yours-truly from chemical-free pie pumpkins grown by my friend Ron Abbott in Walton, Indiana. Much better than the canned stuff for your pumpkin pie! Free pumpkin pie recipes for all.   We're happy to welcome back Chris Griggs of G&amp;G Aquaponics, along with his beautiful leafy greens. Valentine Hill Farm is featuring festive cookies along with their ready-to-heat dinner rolls that you can pop in the oven while the turkey is being carved. Accompany dessert with tea blends from Aahaa Chai, or coffee from Harvest Caf&eacute; Coffee Company.    Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free diners will appreciate the offerings from pH3rments and Trailhead Naturals. Several vendors are now carrying homemade jams and jellies, perfect for glazing meat or vegetable dishes.    Enjoy the $5 breakfast combo, which includes a warm toasted English muffin with your choice of spread, plus coffee and juice, while you shop.   We'll also be taking orders for freshly made Advent and Christmas centerpieces. All sales benefit the market's ongoing GoFundMe campaign.    From the vendors, the volunteers and myself, we send a heartfelt thanks to all of you for your ongoing support, and wish you and your families the happiest Thanksgiving!   See you Saturday from 9-12:30 in the heated clubhouse building just south of the Granary.     ~Market Manager Maria
