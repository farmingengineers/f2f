          Farm to Fork Market is  OPEN on Saturday with Continental Breakfast      
<div><img src="/images/newsletters/0660b30596fdd90a1893f03d4bf102c4.jpg" class="img-0660b30596fdd90a1893f03d4bf102c4"></div>
 Farm to Fork is in the heated building next to the old Granary.        Whether you're starting your holiday shopping, or out around town visiting friends and family, stop by the market. We still have turkeys and fixings for those who celebrate on Saturday or Sunday. For those who just need a break from all the heavy holiday eating, we have plenty of leafy greens, whole grain breads, and probiotic veggies to put your system back in balance.   Enjoy a light breakfast of coffee, juice, and hot English muffins while you shop.   As you start decorating for the holidays, and choosing gifts for loved ones, remember to 'think local, shop local'. Money spent with small businesses stays in the local economy, where it helps save existing jobs and creates new ones.   Many of our farmers and food artisans sell items that make great gifts and stocking stuffers. We will also be selling centerpieces and Advent wreaths made from evergreens picked less than two miles away!   To encourage re-use and recycling, we'll re-open the Farm to Fork yard sale (indoors!) for the next few weeks. There is a limited selection of toys, vintage and contemporary costume jewelry, household items, and other funky stuff to browse through that might just make a perfect gift at a budget price!   See you from 9-12:30 in the heated building next to the granary!           ~Market Manager Maria
