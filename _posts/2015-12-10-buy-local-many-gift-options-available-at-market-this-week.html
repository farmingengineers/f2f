 Farm to Fork is in the heated building next to the old Granary.    Different Kinds of 'Greens' at Market This Week           I've had requests for evergreen branches from a customer, so we'll be adding more 'greens' to the market for the next couple of weeks! We'll be selling armload-size bundles of freshly-cut pine and spruce branches for your holiday decorating this Saturday and next. Like everything else at Farm to Fork, these are organically-grown and hyper-local. We'll also have ready-made centerpieces, handmade with sprigs from the same local trees and shrubs, and complete with candles.    If you're looking for gently-used gifts at good prices, shop our ongoing "indoor yard sale." We still have nice costume jewelry, toys and games, Christmas ornaments and a few vintage finds.    We'll also add our plea to those of all the other organizations asking for your year-end donations. Our

campaign, Sustain and Grow Farm to Fork Market, is still active. No amount is too small to make a big difference. If you don't like making credit card donations on internet sites, we'll happily take your cash or check at the Friends of Farm to Fork table. Every donation is counted toward our goal of $18,000. You can give anonymously if you wish, or you can make a gift in someone's memory or honor.    Proceeds from the fundraising efforts help us pay the rent, keep the lights on, buy advertising and liability insurance, and meet goals suck as getting better signage, completing our not-for-profit status, and attracting quality vendors.    And, it goes without saying that just about everything our farmers grow or make would make a unique gift for someone on your list. Tea, coffee, felted soaps, vegan treats, jams, baked goods, cheeses, apples-the list goes on.  See you from 9-12:30 in the heated building next to the granary!       ~Market Manager Maria
