 Many gift options are available as well as good local foods.    Santa to Stop at Market with Sleigh Loaded with Wholesome Foods           Unnamed sources at the North Pole Workshop confirmed today that the Jolly One would be stopping at Farm to Fork Market this Saturday at 9 AM. He has agreed to stay for three hours to visit with the children and listen to wish lists while parents shop for holiday goodies.    Farmer's tables will be loaded with Christmas cookies and cakes, leafy greens, beef, pork, poultry, eggs, cheeses, milk, teas, coffee beans, vegan treats, fermented cabbage, earth-friendly cleaning products, natural skin-care items, breads, soaps, dried herbs and more.    Centerpieces and hanging wreaths, all handmade from local greenery, are still available. There are also good gift items at the indoor yard sale. All proceeds go directly to the continued operation of the market. Hot coffee, chilled juice and toasted English muffins will be served.   In related news, I extend a sincere thank-you and warm Christmas wishes to everyone who has supported the market this year, as well as the vendors and volunteers who make it possible.    The market will be CLOSED on Saturday, December 26, but will open for the New Year on January 2, 2016.   See you from 9-12:30 in the heated building next to the granary!     ~Market Manager Maria
