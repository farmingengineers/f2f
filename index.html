Join us on Friday nights from 4 - 7 PM at the historic Normandy Farm

(7802 Marsh Rd.), in Traders Point.
Marsh Rd runs parallel to 465 between 71st and 79th Streets.
If you're coming from 71st St, you'll find it on the left,
across the street from St Nicholas Serbian Orthodox Church.

<h3>Indiana's <em>only</em> chemical free farmers market!</h3>

<p>
All of the vendors at the Farm to Fork market produce their products with
your health in mind. Prepared food is made with organic ingredients.
Produce and meat is raised with no artificial chemical inputs. Many
vendors are certified organic or certified naturally grown.
</p>

<h3>Producer only!</h3>

<p>
The Farm to Fork market is producer only.
This means that, when you buy some of the outstanding products, you're
buying from the person who grew it, baked it, or mixed it. Some markets
have vendors who act as a middleman: buying goods and produce from
auction or another farmer, and selling it under their own brand.
