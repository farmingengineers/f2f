<h3>Indiana's <em>only</em> chemical free farmers market!</h3>

<p>
All of the vendors at the Farm to Fork market produce their products with
your health in mind. Prepared food is made with organic ingredients.
Produce and meat is raised with no artificial chemical inputs. Many
vendors are certified organic or certified naturally grown.
</p>

<h3>Producer only!</h3>

<p>
The Farm to Fork market is producer only.
This means that, when you buy some of our outstanding products, you're
buying from the person who grew it or prepared it. Some markets
have vendors who act as a middleman: buying goods and produce from
auction or another farmer, and selling it under their own brand.
At Farm to Fork, all our vendors produce what they sell.
</p>

<h3>Time &amp; Place</h3>

<p>
Join us on Friday nights from 4 - 7 PM at the historic Normandy Farm
on the corner of <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/03Ef4">79th and Marsh Rd</a>
(7802 Marsh Rd.), in the Traders Point area of Indianapolis.
