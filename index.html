<p>join us on Friday nights from 4 - 7 PM at the historic Normandy Farm on the corner of 79th and Marsh Rd (7802 Marsh Rd.), in Traders Point.
Marsh Rd runs parallel to 465 between 71st and 79th Streets. If you're coming from 71st St, you'll find it on the left, across the street from St Nicholas Serbian Orthodox Church. From 86th Street, come south on Connaroe Rd. Turn left on 79th Street, and the farm and Marsh Rd are on the right.</p>

<p>All of the vendors at the Farm to Fork market produce their products with your health in mind. Prepared food is made with organic ingredients. Produce and meat is raised with no artificial chemical inputs. Many vendors are certified organic or certified naturally grown.</p>

<p>The Farm to Fork market is producer only. This means that, when you buy some of the outstanding products, you're buying from the person who grew it, baked it, or mixed it. Some markets have vendors who act as a middleman: buying goods and produce from auction or another farmer, and selling it under their own brand.</p>
