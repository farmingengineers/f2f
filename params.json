Prepared food is made with organic ingredients. Produce and meat is raised with no artificial chemical inputs. Many vendors are certified organic or certified naturally grown.\r\n\r\n### Producer only!\r\n\r\nThe Farm to Fork market is producer only. This means that, when you buy some of the outstanding products, you're buying from the person who grew it, baked it, or mixed it. Some markets have vendors who act as a middleman: buying goods and produce from auction or another farmer, and selling it under their own brand.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
